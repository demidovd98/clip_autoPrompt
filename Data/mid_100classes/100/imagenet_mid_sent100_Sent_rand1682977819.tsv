scorpion	 this scorpion inhabits hot and dry deserts and regions of africa 
scorpion	part of zia research has to do with venom use by these scorpions under predatory and defensive conditions . specifically he wants to see if these scorpions can control the amount of venom they inject into prey items . do they inject greater quantities of venom into larger prey items than smaller ones does the amount of venom injected correspond to struggle intensity of the prey or can a decision on how much venom to use be made prior to attack much as snakes seem capable of as for defensive stings do scorpions inject less venom in the initial sting and increase the dose as the threat continues we will be seeking answers to these questions through a series of carefully controlled experiments 
scorpion	 very few species of scorpions have the ability to squirt their venom

scorpion	 we were only able to find two instances of period or tergiant inverted animals after the wreath meeting both of which used scorpions . there is a tergiant inverted scorpion as the crest of sir william c . this crest is a very unusual depiction of the sherrington scorpion in the town of lacock where the sherrington family was granted the old abbey as a home by henry viii there are period displays of their armory in the home and in the town church and the scorpion seems always to be in the default tergiant posture . 215 gives the arms of cole argent a cheueron gules betweene three scorpions reversed sable . the emblazon shows the scorpions in what the sca would call the tergiant inverted posture . the combination of a emblazon of a crest with a slightly emblazon of armory is not clear evidence of period practices for scorpions and is certainly not compelling evidence for a general period use of the posture tergiant inverted 
scorpion	a significant number of commenters felt that inverting a tergiant charge which is commonly found as tergiant such as a tergiant scorpion or a frog does not hamper the identifiability of the charge so much as to render it unidentifiable and they felt that it should be acceptable . we explicitly decline to rule at this time on whether scorpions tergiant inverted should be considered a weirdness

goose	 snow and ross goose bills are short and stout ideal for digging and muscling out underground plant parts like rhizomes and tubers . the significantly longer and more slender canada goose bill on the other hand is better suited for grasping and snipping plant parts such as blades of grass 
goose	 a warning call given by a single goose alerts the entire flock to danger and the group is able to take precautions in order to avoid predation 
goose	 the canada goose is second on the list with more than 2
goose	 they also help managers differentiate between goose populations on their wintering grounds as well as between migratory and resident populations . waterfowl managers have applied this information to protect vulnerable goose populations and subspecies such as the atlantic canada goose and the aleutian cackling goose formerly the aleutian canada goose while still maximizing hunting opportunity for more abundant goose subspecies 
goose	 every adult has had at least seven months of experience the previous year with decoy spreads and goose calls so they are wary of joining other birds on the ground as they may not actually be geese . the average snow goose lives another seven years once it survives the first year of life

goose	it been five decades since maryland eastern shore was transformed from a waning duck destination into the world first goose hunting capital . since then goose numbers have grown largely unchecked from chesapeake bay clear to humboldt county california . the resurgence of goose populations in north america may be the greatest success story in wildlife management a claim only deer and wild turkey biologists would dispute 
goose	 by 2003 the goose harvest was approaching 4 million which is about the number of mallards we shoot in a typical season . thirty years ago hunters bagged the occasional goose while duck hunting 
goose	north america goose populations have increased for several reasons but chief among them is that geese are not ducks . historically some goose populations were reduced by winter food shortages which lowered survival rates . finally goose management has become increasingly sophisticated in recent years 
goose	 therefore we concentrate on canada geese and light geese because they comprise most of the continent total goose population 
goose	things can get a little complicated on the west coast and goose management in the pacific flyway is no exception 
goose	complicated hunting regulations aside the most unique story in the pacific flyway belongs to the aleutian canada goose 
goose	the final chapter in the pacific flyway is one of redistribution and it involves the smallest of all geese the cackling canada goose 
goose	 if that could be accomplished goose numbers would come down and the destruction of arctic breeding grounds would be slowed 
goose	light goose populations elsewhere are also on the march . controlling light goose numbers may be the most significant challenge faced by waterfowl managers and hunters in the coming years . while harvests of some goose populations may have to be increased to prevent overabundant birds from damaging fragile tundra habitats other goose populations may require harvest restrictions to help them bounce back during years when breeding success is poor

goose	martin did not begin crafting goose and duck calls on a basis until around 1960 
goose	 a salesman by trade fuller secured his place in waterfowling history when in 1885 he was granted the first patent for a goose call 
goose	 but we will not win this battle for habitat without the support of every duck and goose hunter across the continent 
goose	 fish and wildlife service usfws and canadian wildlife service cws in cooperation with numerous state and provincial agencies this document provides the best available estimates of annual duck and goose populations and habitat conditions across north america most important waterfowl breeding areas 
goose	although annual changes in duck and goose numbers have important implications for waterfowlers they do not necessarily influence individual hunter success 
goose	central flyway goose populations also remain healthy . on the prairies flooding may have negatively impacted gosling production in some areas but large canada goose numbers remain well above their averages across the great plains 
goose	this was a very good year for mississippi flyway goose populations 
goose	 goose production also varied considerably across northern breeding areas but most populations remain near or above their management objectives 
goose	 pacific flyway goose populations also had generally good breeding success in alaska and the western canadian arctic and fall populations of all species should be similar to or above 2003 levels 
goose	the outlook for central flyway goose populations is mixed 
goose	the outlook is as bright for mississippi flyway goose populations . a cold late spring and inclement weather took a toll on goose production on major breeding areas across the central canadian arctic and the hudson bay lowlands . midcontinent light goose numbers remain high but reduced gosling production on northern breeding areas will result in fewer juvenile birds flying south this fall

goose	 after several consecutive years of high goose populations waterfowl managers have recently liberalized harvest regulations for the birds . the pacific goose approximately in western alaska primarily on the vast delta . more than any other factor breeding success among goose populations is influenced by weather conditions on their arctic breeding grounds

goose	in southern manitoba the giant canada goose weighs 12 to 14 pounds a whopper compared to most other populations of canadas and it has the and most prolonged call of any of the canada geese . this is the goose many of us typically see in city parks and on municipal golf courses 
goose	 we would see additional diversity if we looked at the other 16 canada goose populations throughout the continent 
goose	even when goose families are broken up because of the death of a parent or a sibling orphaned or widowed birds still associate with other canada geese from the same breeding population 
goose	 that is even though the odds are against pairing with a sibling a parent or an aunt or uncle it is highly likely that an individual goose will pair with a bird from the same general area where it was hatched 
goose	 polygamy is uncommon among waterfowl and observed in only 7 percent of species including the ruddy duck musk duck australia comb duck south america africa and southern asia and maccoa duck africa all of which are ducks and the magpie goose australia 
goose	 today these birds rarely venture beyond southern illinois but growing flocks of resident canadas are helping to revive the grand sandbar goose hunting that nash buckingham wrote about so many years ago 
goose	in this era of booming canada goose populations it hard to imagine that just more than 50 years ago the birds were a rarity across much of north america . in fact the giant canada goose which historically nested throughout the upper mississippi river valley was believed to be extinct and many other canada goose populations had been reduced to perilously low levels . fish and wildlife service usfws estimated that the mississippi valley canada goose population alone had a fall flight of nearly 1 . the canada goose branta canadensis is among the most successful and genetically diverse of the world waterfowl . they range in size from the cackling canada goose b . canadensis minima which is slightly larger than a mallard to the giant canada goose b . most canada goose populations are presently thriving and more of the birds likely exist in north america today than at any other time in history . in recent decades some canada goose populations have suffered sharp declines while others remain below optimal management levels . the following is an overview of the status of canada goose populations by flyway compiled from surveys conducted by the usfws canadian wildlife service and cooperating state and provincial wildlife agencies . the atlantic flywaythe birthplace of north america waterfowling tradition the atlantic flyway is home to two large migratory populations of the interior canada goose subspecies b . by 1995 breeding pair counts in northern quebec had declined by 75 percent since the time that surveys were initiated in 1987 forcing waterfowl managers to close the general canada goose season throughout the atlantic flyway states . the sjbp is among the few canada goose populations that have remained persistently below management goals and restrictive harvest regulations for the birds have been in place since the early 1990s 
goose	follow that gooseyou can track the migration of atlantic canada geese from the comfort of your own home by going to geese in space 
goose	 the population status of these different subspecies varies and many of the birds share the same migration and wintering areas making canada goose harvest management in the pacific flyway far more challenging than in other regions . in 2000 the usfws estimated the fall cackling canada goose population to be roughly birds similar to the 1999 estimate . the aleutian canada goose named for its breeding grounds in alaska aleutian island chain has also staged an impressive comeback in recent decades . this small canada goose was driven to the brink of extinction earlier this century when foxes were introduced to the aleutian islands . following the stunning success of these recovery efforts the usfws has removed the aleutian canada goose from the federal threatened species list . the pacific flyway other two small canada goose subspecies lesser and taverner canada geese breed throughout the north slope and the interior of alaska and largely winter in washington and oregon . the much larger dusky canada goose weighing from eight to 10 pounds is named for its dark body plumage varying among individuals from chestnut to chocolate brown . among the most threatened waterfowl in north america the entire dusky canada goose population nests in the copper river delta of southeastern alaska and winters in the willamette valley of western oregon 
goose	 so the first lesson learned was that this type of adventure is not something for everyone particularly those who have limited time to pursue their duck and goose hunting passion 
goose	 this is one of the last frontiers in goose biology 
goose	 without a fundamental understanding of the ecosystem it will be impossible to monitor changes that might affect future duck and goose populations 
goose	 his winning design a backlit snow goose adorns the federal stamp 
goose	 goose production also varied considerably across northern breeding areas but most populations remain healthy . goose production was variable across primary breeding areas in the north . however most pacific flyway goose populations remain healthy overall and fall flights of canada geese lesser snows ross geese geese and pacific brant should be similar to last year . the status of central flyway goose populations is mixed 
goose	 canada goose numbers should be similar to or slightly higher than last year with the exception of the mississippi valley population which is down significantly 
goose	aerial surveys conducted in july by the usfws indicated that both duck and goose production was highly variable across the surveyed area . goose production on many northern breeding areas also was down from last year but most populations remain healthy overall . pacific flyway goose production was variable across northern breeding areas this year . as in the pacific flyway production among most central flyway goose populations was down from 1999 following a late spring thaw on northern breeding areas . mississippi flyway canada goose populations are expected to be similar to last year with the exception of the southern james bay population which is down considerably 
goose	hunting success remains highduring the past five years surging duck and goose populations have provided waterfowlers with unprecedented hunting opportunities throughout north america . goose harvest of roughly 3 million birds also was just below an high 
goose	 if does occur the male goose will follow the female to her breeding area 
goose	 clad in my bulky waterfowl parka and muddy neoprene waders i felt out of place going goose hunting in such a aircraft especially so far from civilization . my hunting partners and i quickly went to work placing our mixed spread of canada and snow goose silhouettes and windsock decoys in small groups surrounding shallow pools of seawater left by the falling tide . although polar bears are largely inactive in september during the goose season these top predators will never pass up an easy meal and should always be treated with the utmost respect . my hunting partners broke into a medley of double clucks grunts and moans on their goose calls as a long wavering line of interior canadas winged rapidly in our direction . the lodge was a favorite destination of the legendary outdoor writer jimmy robinson who made annual goose hunting trips there throughout the 1970s . after discussing our hunting plans over a huge breakfast we departed with our guides for the morning goose hunt on the surrounding tundra . after a hearty lunch back at the lodge we had the option of returning to the flats for more goose hunting or walking the surrounding tundra for willow ptarmigan . although i enjoyed the goose hunting and fishing to the fullest the most memorable part of the trip for me was the camaraderie shared with the other guests and staff 
goose	 it is this energy released into a duck or goose that brings the bird down 
goose	 researchers have determined that canada goose language includes more than 20 distinct sounds . perhaps no one can be sure of the exact topic of each conversation but goose hunters who harbor hopes of outstretched wings over their decoys would do well to master at least a small portion of this colorful dialect 
goose	talking goose takes practice which takes time which takes discipline . the dividends of this labor however can make the difference between an endless string of frustrating birdless days and success in the goose fields on a regular basis

jellyfish	radially symmetrical and composed of acellular mesoglea two cell layers and a primitive nervous system jellyfish are an elegantly simple launching point to investigate how material properties of the musculoskeletal system shape the dynamics of locomotion . this study asks how such nonlinearities determine the dynamical response of a jellyfish simple geometry subject to periodic forcing . we compare the stiffness of mesoglea between three species of jellyfish mitrocoma cellularia polyorchis penicillatus and aequorea victoria each with a distinctive overall shape . aequorea victoria a jellyfish with unevenly distributed mesoglea and unusual swimming kinematics has the highest mesoglea exponent making it the most strongly nonlinear while mitrocoma cellularia a jellyfish with a relatively simple geometry and typical swimming kinematics has the lowest 
jellyfish	since the earliest behavioral investigations of scyphomedusan and cubomedusan swimming swim contractions were found to be controlled by multiple centers that were spread around the margin of the jellyfish . the resultant pacemaker redundancy was examined in three previous modeling studies in which contractile activity in a piece of jellyfish containing a single rhopalium was used to construct models of networks . we conducted a similar study on the cubomedusa carybdea marsupialis but our initial results are not consistent with a model in which pacemakers interact via simple resetting linkages thus challenging the notion of how pacemakers interact in cubozoan and scyphozoan jellyfish

jellyfish	 tuning for swimming performance in hydrozoan jellyfish depends on springs and temporal patterns of force productionradial symmetry and primitive neuromuscular organization make jellyfish for exploring the dynamic consequences of the interplay between muscle forcing material properties geometry and fluid motion . jellyfish composed predominantly of mesoglea have a characteristic nonlinear response to an applied strain . we find that 1 a coupled model of jellyfish locomotion effectively captures details of jellyfish swimming kinematics 2 the extent of the in bell structural properties has a profound effect on swimming performance often giving rise to increasing swimming speeds with increasing and 3 subtle details of the timing of muscle force production its fourier components are increasingly important with ever greater structural forces revealing patterns of muscle forcing that maximize swimming speed and efficiency 
jellyfish	 swimming in jellyfish aurelia aurita ontogenetic scaling of morphology motion and mechanics . the scyphozoan jellyfish aurelia aurita increases its mass by as much as three orders of magnitude in a lifetime and their bodies change from being prolate more tall than wide as juveniles to being oblate more wide than tall as adults . does this change in body shape facilitate higher swimming performance than if these jellyfish maintained the same shape over their ontogeny we addressed this question by measuring the body shape and swimming kinematics of jellyfish spanning nearly three orders of magnitude in body size and by mathematically modeling the hydrodynamics of their swimming . we found that larger jellyfish swam with a lower pulse frequency a disproportionately slower speed and lower propulsive efficiency . however our simulations also suggest that speed and efficiency would be greater if jellyfish maintained a prolate body shape throughout ontogeny

sea lion	 eric jorgensen and his legal team in juneau have prevailed in a string of court rulings that forced the government to regulate groundfishing in the north pacific with a closer eye on protecting the endangered steller sea lion 
sea lion	the lawsuit also challenges the highway administration refusal to adequately consider the effects of road construction operation and maintenance on bald eagles and steller sea lions . similarly steller sea lions are listed as threatened under the endangered species act which protects the animals and their habitat . despite the fact that the road would pass directly through designated critical sea lion habitat at gran point the highway administration refused to consult appropriately with the national marine fisheries service about potential effects on steller sea lions 
sea lion	 the real winners in the suit are steller sea lions seals sea birds and the rest of the marine creatures that make the waters off alaska among the richest on earth 
sea lion	 the court ruled in our favor in virtually all the issues we litigated over the past several years and has directed the government to protect sea lions and their habitat and fully assess the impacts of the fisheries on the entire north pacific ecosystem 
sea lion	most recently in december 2002 the federal district court for the western district of washington ruled that the biological opinion governing the fisheries was illegal because it did not adequately consider the effects of federally managed groundfish fisheries on endangered steller sea lions and their habitat 
sea lion	steller sea lions in western alaska have declined by almost 90 percent in the past several decades . the plunge in sea lion numbers in the gulf of alaska and bering sea coincides with the rise in industrial fishing in the sea lions home waters . for the past several years the national marine fisheries service the federal government agency responsible for protecting sea lions has acknowledged that the massive federally managed fisheries that target sea lion prey in important sea lion habitat had to be modified to protect sea lions 
sea lion	the north pacific is one of the most magnificent marine systems in the world and the federal government was doing its job protecting sea lions whales sea birds and all the other rich wildlife there said searles 
sea lion	 for the endangered sea lions threatened sea otters harbor seals and the large variety of sea birds and waterfowl that share a delicate ecosystem along the southern coast of alaska and the aleutian islands such a spill would indeed be devastating 
sea lion	 and all the way up in our juneau office we been doing our best to arrest the decline in the steller sea lion population 
sea lion	the abundant waters of the bering sea and gulf of alaska once teemed with one of the world largest concentrations of sea lions fur and harbor seals and seabirds . this fishing also takes food away from the ocean predators including the now endangered steller sea lion 
sea lion	 some of the world largest populations of steller sea lions fur and harbor seals and seabirds depend on pollock mackerel cod some of the 300 fish species in the area 
sea lion	 the three species that have declined most significantly in western alaska steller sea lions harbor seals and fur seals are the three that compete most directly for the fish targeted by the trawl fisheries 
sea lion	the precipitous decline of the steller sea lion as well as harbor and fur seals and seabirds coincides closely with the development of intensive trawl fisheries . rather than limit the expansion of commercial fisheries to areas outside critical habitat in the years after steller sea lions were listed under the endangered species act nmfs allowed the groundfish trawl fisheries to increase rather than decrease their catch inside sea lion critical habitat areas . the fisheries became compressed into short periods and focused in small areas that overlap significantly with designated critical foraging areas for sea lions 
sea lion	 the court has directed the government to protect sea lions and their habitat 
sea lion	most recently in december 2002 the federal district court in the western district of washington ruled that the biological opinion governing the fisheries was illegal because it did not adequately consider the effects of federally managed groundfish fisheries on endangered steller sea lions and their habitat 
sea lion	 the court concluded that the current fishing plan is illegal because the national marine fisheries service failed to evaluate the effects of fishing on sea lions and their habitat 
sea lion	the court concludes that the 2001 biop finding of no adverse modification of critical habitat and no jeopardy to the continued existence of steller sea lions is arbitrary and capricious because the necessary analysis of the impact of the fishing plan on steller sea lions their prey and their critical habitat was not performed 
sea lion	from the beginning this case has been about improving the management of our oceans and protection for endangered steller sea lions and their habitat said dr
sea lion	steller sea lion populations in western alaska have declined by almost 90 percent in the past few decades along with similar declines in populations of other marine mammals and seabirds 
sea lion	we challenged the 2001 biop because nmfs approved a plan with weaker protections sponsored by the industry without adequately looking at the impact on sea lions 
sea lion	the plaintiffs said they would work to ensure that nmfs completes the work necessary to analyze fishing impacts on steller sea lions their habitat and other marine resources 
sea lion	if you are not alarmed by the serious declines of steller sea lions otters fur seals birds and other marine life in the north pacific you not paying attention said phil kline of american oceans campaign

sea lion	 but we are hopeful that the agency will continue with its plan to protect sea lions from extinction whether in this administration or in the next one 
sea lion	 scientists concluded in the biological opinion that alaska groundfish fisheries harm endangered steller sea lions and their habitat . to mitigate the adverse effects described in the biological opinion nmfs prescribed a reasonable and prudent alternative rpa aimed at reducing fishing impacts in the sea lions critical habitat

sea lion	by authoring a spending bill rider senator stevens has proven that he is bent on putting profits for big fishing interests ahead of the survival of both steller sea lions and the very coastal communities he professes to care about said heather weiner senior legislative counsel of earthjustice legal defense fund . anyone who truly wishes to save steller sea lions protect the north pacific ecosystem and uphold the endangered species act must oppose senator stevens rider 
sea lion	 the rider would also delay implementation of the rpa or any other new measures to protect steller sea lions in federal waters until yet another scientific review of the biological opinion is completed and the fishing north pacific fishery management council has developed its own plan for managing groundfish fisheries in the bering islands and gulf of alaska 
sea lion	senator stevens is attempting to throw the endangered species act out the window even in the face of clear evidence that steller sea lions are in peril due to intensive industrial fishing in their critical habitat said ted morton policy director for american oceans campaign 
sea lion	a federal judge has dissolved an injunction that restricts trawl fishing in the steller sea lion critical habitat following the release of a biological opinion on december 1 2000 by the national marine fisheries service 
sea lion	to mitigate the adverse effects described in the biological opinion nmfs has prescribed and intends to implement a reasonable and prudent alternative rpa aimed at reducing fishing impacts in the sea lions critical habitat 
sea lion	the injunction did what it was supposed to protect steller sea lions until nmfs complied with the law and completed a comprehensive scientific analysis of the impacts of north pacific fisheries on the endangered marine mammals said niaz dorry greenpeace oceans campaigner 
sea lion	the plaintiffs in this case have argued for years that industrial fishing destroys marine habitat and removes vast amounts of fish that are essential to the health of the entire ecosystem specifically the endangered steller sea lion 
sea lion	our principal objective is to promote a healthy ecosystem that protects endangered steller sea lions and ensures a sustainable future for alaska coastal communities said phil kline fisheries program director for american oceans campaign aoc

sea lion	actually teddy roosevelt acted with foresight because by 1922 a visitor reported the area to have a silence interrupted only by the raucous squawking of sea gulls and the terrifying roar of sea lions . the ocean may win and totally destroy the islands but chances are that future eruptions will restore them in some form and that birds and sea lions will continue to roost there in the intervals between eruptions 
sea lion	 some scientists think the population crash is due to killer whales eating more sea otters in the aleutians possibly because traditional killer whale prey such as large whales and sea lions have also dwindled in the aleutians 
sea lion	 recently researchers have questioned whether killer whales have been responsible for declining numbers of sea otters and steller sea lions off the coast of alaska 
sea lion	these perfect predator teeth help support the idea that killer whales are eating more sea lions seals and sea otters and that humans are behind a drastic change in the northern pacific ocean and bering sea ecosystems 
sea lion	 now the researchers are going a step further by arguing that after japanese and russian whalers removed at least million great whales from the north pacific ocean and southern bering sea between 1949 and 1969 killer whales were forced to hunt other species such as steller sea lions fur and harbor seals and sea otters 
sea lion	springer and his colleagues think the killer whale is behind historic declines of steller sea lions and sea otters and the current falling numbers of northern fur seals and harbor seals 
sea lion	 killer whales mostly eat sea lions seals and other marine mammals that spend most of their time far offshore away from sea otters 
sea lion	the whale sightings in shallow waters frequented by sea otters coincided with a nosedive in the population of harbor seals and steller sea lions but estes said he was skeptical about the killer otter connection 
sea lion	 hatfield concluded that the lack of reports of killer whales eating sea otters may be due to the fact that killer whales have only recently shifted their diets to include sea otters possibly because of the decline of steller sea lions and harbor seals 
sea lion	 in a recent anchorage daily news article director andy rosenberg of the national marine fisheries service said a link may exist between overfishing of pollock and the decline of the steller sea lion a killer whale prey species that has declined more than 70 percent since the 1960s

Chihuahua	the otero mesa in new mexico is one of the wildest places in the united states and contains two important stretches of chihuahuan desert grasslands one of the most endangered ecosystem types in north america 
Chihuahua	the grasslands at risk comprise more than a million acres of chihuahuan desert between carlsbad nm and el paso tx 
Chihuahua	 panelists and speakers including actress mira sorvino expressed frustration with ongoing abuses in such places as the niger delta the darfur region in sudan and the mexican border communities of ciudad juarez and chihuahua city . we have the power to pressure governments said cynthia bejarano a professor at new mexico state university and of amigos de las mujeres de juarez a group active in trying to stop the killing of women and children in ciudad juarez and chihuahua city 
Chihuahua	chihuahua to live with her in el paso 
Chihuahua	 other deserts are the great basin in nevada the mojave in california and the chihuahua in mexico 
Chihuahua	 this pottery was imported throughout pueblo grande occupation and came from at least five different cultural regions reaching out in all four cardinal directions the anasazi prehistoric pueblo and hopi in northern arizona the prescott area to the northwest the mogollon and mimbres to the east the lower colorado river to the west the tucson basin to the south the trincheras region of northern sonora mexico and casas grandes to the southeast in northern chihuahua mexico 
Chihuahua	we bred aplomado falcons in captivity at our ucsc breeding facility for reintroduction in texas in cooperation with the peregrine fund and the chihuahuan desert research institute 
Chihuahua	 he has taught courses in population biology and genetics and in 1973 he founded the chihuahuan desert research institute 
Chihuahua	 these vehicles will continue to be operated according to the paired city understandings with the mexican states of coahuila and chihuahua and the bilateral understanding with the mexican state of tamaulipas 
Chihuahua	the beauty of the chihuahuan desert that surrounds the el paso region is not that usual beauty experienced by texans 
Chihuahua	my question i guess after that statement is what is the cooperation with mexico on their corridors i know we build up to a bridge i know they have toll roads down to monterrey and chihuahua and those areas 
Chihuahua	as a brief personal note i want you to know that my hometown the city of sunland park new mexico is strategically located at that single geographical point where three states texas new mexico and chihuahua and two nations the united states and mexico come together 
Chihuahua	 the trade climate in el paso and chihuahua are very healthy the existing bridges in the urbanized area of el paso are already at capacity the present existing bridge is very narrow and incompatible to the commercial traffic necessary through the area 
Chihuahua	the state of chihuahua has already begun the design stage of their plans to build a highway from samalayucca as well as from the inner parts of juarez to take the traffic overflow into the but it really the one we refer to as fabens . and we have also received a letter from the governor of chihuahua expressing his concern to expedite this process and in support of the project 
Chihuahua	 this is the eastern shuttle if you will coming up from chihuahua and also getting much of the maquiladora industrial parks of the eastern side of the valley of juarez to go through there and so what we really looking at is how do we expedite the creation of this infrastructure that will move product in a radically different way commissioner williamson in the smart border concept that you embraced and the state has embraced 
Chihuahua	senator shapleigh i think we in favor of doing the best option for commercial traffic in that area for the future and one of the issues is obviously going to be what is chihuahua going to do 
Chihuahua	 i assure you that that is the right location the governor of chihuahua is totally sold on it and their plans on that highway connecting from the pan american highway to the bridge are well into the planning stages of actual engineering 
Chihuahua	this is one of the reasons the governor of chihuahua is so interested in this location because it will divert traffic from the downtown area and eliminate the present pollution that we presently have by unnecessary trucks in the downtown area 
Chihuahua	 even in the last year we seen tremendous progress along that corridor in the commitments that we see both in the mexican states of sinaloa and chihuahua toward the development of this corridor and making it become a reality 
Chihuahua	kinsey owen in kansas city back in 1872 and he was trying to find the shortest route to bring goods from the west coast of the american continent to the mid part of the united states and he reasoned that the port of topolobampo and the corridor laid out from there would be the most efficient route and the shortest route and it was along that route that he set out to build a railroad and the south orient from chihuahua over to topolobampo was not completed until 1961 
Chihuahua	copper canyon and then into the city of chihuahua 
Chihuahua	chihuahua is the mexican state that has the longest border with texas and as a result they are very key players not only in this corridor but in others and it my pleasure now to introduce for an update of what going on in the state of chihuahua the coordinator of projects and studies for the chihuahua department of transportation mr . he will share with you the commitment that the state of chihuahua as well as the mexican federal government has to this project

cheetah, chetah, Acinonyx jubatus	peter gros i do know of any fatal encounters of humans by cheetahs . generally cheetahs are interested in antelope as a food source and fear people . however when the average cheetah has a range of over 300 square miles there will be sightings of cheetahs by humans and people misunderstand their presence as threatening rather than a cheetah just exploring its territory . as a result of the research being performed at the cheetah conservation fund the data found through scat sampling proves that cheetahs much prefer to eat wild game over domestic stock 
cheetah, chetah, Acinonyx jubatus	peter gros the maximum weight of a cheetah is usually around 140 pounds where leopards get to be much larger . cheetahs have very small heads and are easily distinguished by the black teardrop lines under their eyes their very long narrow legs and their large claws like a dog 
cheetah, chetah, Acinonyx jubatus	peter gros thousands of years before livestock was available the cheetah wild kill instincts were firmly set in place 
cheetah, chetah, Acinonyx jubatus	peter gros i have not heard of cheetahs being affected although cheetahs can be vaccinated if they have to be relocated and cheetahs are vulnerable to some diseases that dogs carry . all cheetahs in zoos in the united states are vaccinated for the possibility of those diseases as well . at least in namibia currently the cheetah population is holding its own so i quite optimistic that with a greater understanding of the people who share the habitat with this magnificent animal it will be here for future generations to enjoy

syringe	we carry a complete line of supplies for gas chromatographs including capillary columns microneedle valves syringes septa glass lined stainless steel tubing gc ferrules and gc fittings 
syringe	 direct injection into the gc like using a gc injection syringe 
syringe	 if a syringe is used there is also the possibility that the sample might condense in the syringe needle itself . in one instance in which we were analyzing polynuclear aromatics with the thermal desorption technique the higher boiling analytes condensed in the thermal desorption syringe needle even though the gc injection port was set to 325c . to overcome this condensation of we developed a new low dead volume injection port liner to improve the heat transfer to the syringe needle and to the septum area of the injection port 
syringe	0 ml of the headspace gas was injected into the gc injection port via a heated syringe and at the front of the gc column using our gc 
syringe	silicone peaks originating from the septum can also result from the incorrect selection of gc syringe needles . also as mentioned above longer syringe needles deposit the samples into the center or lower portion of the injection port further away from the septa area 
syringe	 part sipl10 to provide better heat transfer to the septum area of the injection port and also to the syringe needle . 63 mm diameter syringe needle 
syringe	 in addition the tight fit of the injection port liner to the syringe needle provides for better heat transfer to the syringe needle and thereby improves the delivery of higher boilers into the gc injection port in the headspace and thermal desorption delivery techniques 
syringe	as noted by sge in the mass spec tips section of a previous issue of this newsletter 4 by adjusting the position of the quartz wool plug in the injection port liner so that the syringe needle tip is wiped during the injection the gc peak shape can be improved as well as reproducibility and linearity without adversely affecting boiling point discrimination 
syringe	 direct injection into the gc like using a gc injection syringe 
syringe	5 ul syringe was loaded with 0 . the syringe was emptied until no sample volume remained . the syringe was then injected into the gc injection port utilizing the residual volume of sample retained by the syringe needle as the sample for analysis 
syringe	5 ml can be accurately removed from the sample into a heated syringe for injection into the gc 
syringe	 once the samples were collected they were purged with helium at 50 for 5 minutes spiked with 100 ng of cymene internal standard by injecting 1 ul of a 100 of a cymene stock solution in methanol by syringe injection into the tenax matrix and then purged for an additional 5 minutes at 50 to remove the methanol . the desorption tube with sample and internal standard was then attached to the short path thermal desorption system and a syringe needle attached 
syringe	when ready for analysis the glt desorption tubes are fitted with a syringe needle and attached to the desorption unit . e direct injection into the gc much like a syringe 
syringe	 when ready for analysis the glt desorption tubes are fitted with a syringe needle and attached to the desorption unit figure 2 . direct injection into the gc much like a syringe 
syringe	 the desorption unit can be easily lifted off the injection port of the gc for conventional injection of samples via syringe or autosamplers and can be easily slipped back onto the gc injection port nut for desorbing samples into the injection system 
syringe	 the desorption tube with syringe needle is attached to the autoinjector assembly and carrier gas flows through the desorption tube and needle continuously when activated by the appropriate switch on the electronics console . it can be easily viewed that the syringe needle is proceeding properly into the gc injection port and that the desorption unit is properly aligned 
syringe	for example in the splitless mode of operation at low flows the ball in the rotameter normally falls down to zero upon the initial injection of the desorption tube syringe into the gc injection port but will eventually rise back up to its set valve . if the rotameter continues to read zero it indicates that the syringe needle is probably clogged with a plug of septa material and is restricting flow through the syringe assembly 
syringe	 this gauge can be used in conjunction with the pressure gauge on the gc injection port to regulate the operation of the system as well as troubleshoot when problems are occurring such as leaking seals plugged syringes and bad septa in the gc 
syringe	 since the gc was probably used previously for regular syringe type liquid injections the injection port can be assumed to be contaminated as discussed in the injection port discussion above

toilet seat	she was feeling horny though maybe it was the fever she always felt really sexy when she had a fever she remembered the time she was laid up with a sore throat in amsterdam and she and steph decided to splurge on a nice hotel until she got better after two days she felt almost well still with a slight fever it was very cold so they stayed in bed for days bundled up making love over and over again not really over and over again more like constantly no real starting and stopping just perpetual kissing and hugging perpetually warm and wet almost like suspended animation not leaving the room for days not knowing or caring what time or even what day it was ordering room service eating strawberries off of each others bellies until finally their bodies weak and drained they staggered out of the hotel to the train station in the early morning frost not daring to wash off their new skin made of dried saliva strawberry juice and other secret elixirs s remembered how her stomach muscles ached from coming so much she heard a toilet flush somewhere in the building opened her eyes she was sitting on the toilet seat her pajamas around her ankles her right hand buried between her legs she closed her eyes again and leaned back up against the toilet back extended her legs and shifted her weight so that her pelvis was thrust forward and exposed and she gripped the rim of the toilet seat with her left hand and with the middle finger of her right she began to probe and caress her lips and the soft place just to the side of the hood of her clit she rocked back and forth slightly on the toilet seat and as she masturbated she thought of steph belly hard nipples and the salty sour taste of her vagina she thought of the rough almost feline quality of steph tongue her long dangerous fingernails the silky hair of her armpits and the warm liquor and basil scent of her breath she thought of steph long unshaven legs her rough black coily pubic hair her stained old maid cotton panties her flannel nightshirt her thick muscular ass the mole on the inside of her right thigh way up almost where the thighs join she began to rub herself a bit more frantically now the small sounds steph made the husky breathing the delirious movements of her legs and ass the strength of her embrace the sleepy stupid lascivious expression on her face she opened her eyes and she could almost see her orgasm floating up above her a discreet shadow suspended just beneath the whiteness of the bathroom ceiling a subtle darkened bluish vapor hovering above her head she closed her eyes again thought of the delicious sensation of steph rough tongue and full pouting lips between her legs imagined her hands gently stroking steph hair as that tongue explored her vagina and her lips caressed her clit she sped up her motions now as the tip of steph tongue found her clit and traced delicate slow circles around it s opened her eyes and saw the shadow of her orgasm start to descend slowly slowly down down as the rhythm of steph tongue began to increase and the motion became slightly rougher and less controlled she kept her eyes opened and watched as the shadow slowly almost imperceptibly dropped down towards her until now it was only about a foot above her eyes and mouth she had a hard time thinking of steph anymore she could imagine an entire person her imagination had contracted excluding everything but the mouth tongue and lips the shadow floated about six inches above her forehead now with her left hand she opened up her pajama top and squeezed her right nipple between her fingers and thumb now even steph mouth was disappearing now it was only her tongue now it was no longer even her tongue it was just a tongue now it was no longer even a tongue it was nothing a beautiful violent nothing between her legs the promise of a vacuum that would empty her the shadow was now at the tip of her forehead she heard a moan almost a scream she closed her eyes tried to think of steph but could not the shadow blocked out all thought it was over her mouth now it was suffocating her she did care the shadow slowly descended from her mouth down to her neck and then her breasts and belly it hesitated at her navel she raised her pelvis up to meet it but it stayed there hovering floating suspended a couple of inches above her vagina she sobbed still it would move it just stayed there she increased the rhythm of her hand rolled her nipple between her fingers harder harder until it hurt sobbed again then the shadow began to drop slowly slowly down over her hips slowly slowly down to the top of her vagina slowly slowly to her clit she closed her eyes her body began to twitch spasmodically she slowed down the rhythm of her hand she felt the shadow stop right at the lip of her vagina she felt it begin to probe and tickle her clit trying to open her up trying to empty her out she looked down a single tip of negative flame slowly caressing slowly coaxing her vagina to open a vacuum a void a nothingness caressing her luring enticing her trying to empty her out trying to gently pry open the gate between her legs slowly slowly her gate was very strong but the shadow was patient and very alluring there was no hurry slowly slowly slowly slowly she closed her eyes in expectation the image of steph face hair and body reappeared suddenly the gate was open she was completely emptied out and she was nothing she was nothing for a long time waves and waves of nothing and nothingness for a long time she was nothing but just as she experienced the nothing of the shadow she noticed a slight pain in her chest the pleasure and nothing of the shadow between her legs coincided exactly with a palpitation and pain localized near her sternum so as her vagina violently contracted in bliss and ecstasy her heart just as furiously constricted in sorrow and grief and as the shadow began finally to leave falling down from her vagina dropping quickly to her knees her ankles her feet and finally disappearing through the floor she noticed an emptiness not between her legs but between her breasts a mark not of joy but of despair it was as if the shade had emptied not her sex but her heart
