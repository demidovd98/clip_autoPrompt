bucket	method that tried to manipulate the bucket brigade or the bucket 
bucket	A bucket represents a chunk of data 
bucket	The stream of data is represented by bucket brigades 
bucket	the presented bucket brigade has passed through several filters some buckets were removed some modified and some added 
bucket	to read and write the data and the second using bucket brigades to accomplish the same and allow for connection filters
bucket	at the same module but this time implemented by manipulating bucket brigades and which runs its output through a connection output
bucket	The handler receives the incoming data via bucket bridges one at a time in a loop 
bucket	pass the whole brigade unmodified without even looking at the buckets 
bucket	These data chunks are stored in buckets which form bucket brigades 
bucket	bucket brigades behind the scenes it still important to understand bucket brigades

bucket	performed at the beginning of the handler and the EOS bucket was sent in together with the data the EOS event
bucket	brigade is requested from the upstream filter or when the bucket brigade is passed to the downstream filter 
bucket	and output filters differ in the ways they acquire the bucket brigades which includes the data that they filter 
bucket	call which in turn applies its modifications and sends the bucket brigade to the next filter etc
bucket	modperl provides two interfaces to filtering a direct bucket brigades manipulation interface and a simpler interface

bucket	ask yourself why did we have to go through the bucket brigades filters when this all can be done so much
