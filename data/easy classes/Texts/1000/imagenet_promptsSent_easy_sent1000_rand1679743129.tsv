cucumber	Originally people used to only eat the cucumbers fresh . It was until later that people discovered that putting cucumbers into vinegar would cause them to turn to pickles . They were a big hit because people could then enjoy cucumbers all year long . Pickling allowed people to use cucumbers during the winter months 
cucumber	Technology has affected the cucumber industry . Today cucumbers can be planted and harvested by machines however in North Carolina nearly all of the crop is harvested by hand 
cucumber	People are eating more cucumbers than ever before 
cucumber	With it popularity growers are developing new varieties of cucumbers that will produce a better quality cucumber and will grow more in less space . This is so that if a field used to produce 100 cucumbers it will now produce 200 cucumbers that are even better than the original 100 
cucumber	There are both spring and fall crops of pickling cucumbers . During cucumbers growing season of May through October they prefer sunny weather with some rain 
cucumber	The soil for cucumbers must have the right amounts of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium to grow well . This is why cucumbers are planted on raised beds or rows to allow excess water to drain away from the plant 
cucumber	This is because as cucumbers grow they are sprayed with herbicides to prevent weed from growing . The herbicides will leave a residue or leftover matter in the ground which is not good for young cucumbers 
cucumber	Besides herbicides tractors are used in cucumber production 
cucumber	Once cucumbers reach the right size they are ready to be harvested . As soon as cucumbers are picked they can be graded by size and sorted either in the field or at the packing shed . After being sorted by size slicing cucumbers are washed and waxed to prevent moisture loss and packed in waterproof cardboard cartons . These cucumbers are then placed in hydrocoolers at 45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit and then stored at 50 degrees and 95 humidity before being shipped to produce buyers . This process keeps the cucumbers fresh longer than if they were stored at room temperature . Pickling cucumbers are sorted by size and sent to processor to made into pickles

cucumber	There are two basic types of cucumbers those eaten fresh called slicing varieties and those cultivated for pickling . The slicing cucumbers most commonly seen in supermarkets are varieties that are usually 6 to 9 long and have glossy dark green skin and tapering ends 
cucumber	In recent years slicing cucumbers grown in greenhouses have become widely available . Most of these varieties originated in Europe they are sometimes called European or English cucumbers and they tend to be thin smooth skinned and one to two feet in length . For that reason many people find greenhouse cucumbers easier to digest hence another of its names the burpless cucumber

cucumber	This publication discusses cultural controls and alternative pesticides that can be used in control of downy mildew a destructive disease of cucurbits that is most destructive to cucumber and cantaloupe 
cucumber	Downy mildew caused by the fungal organism Pseudoperonospora cubensis is most destructive to cucumber and cantaloupe though all cucurbits are susceptible 
cucumber	One of the principal means of managing downy mildew in cantaloupe and cucumber is the use of genetically resistant cultivars . Resistance has not been developed in other cucurbits though some squash varieties like Super Select and Zucchini Select are considered to be tolerant 5 as are cucumber varieties like Poinsett and Galaxie . 6 The Virginia Extension publication Downy Mildew of Cucurbits 3 identifies other resistant cucumber cultivars 
cucumber	It is recommended for use on cucumber beetles flea beetles Mexican bean beetles squash bugs aphids mites and CPB 
cucumber	Chemical insecticides that contain feeding stimulants with a small amount of carbaryl Sevin is a common commercial formulation can control cucumber beetles while protecting pollinators and other insect species 
cucumber	Several species of cucumber beetles exist in the US each with a specific range feeding habit and ability to transmit diseases 
cucumber	Adult striped cucumber beetles are about inch long and with 3 distinct black stripes that extend from the head to the tip of the abdomen . 2 The eastern striped cucumber beetle Acalymma vittatum is found mostly east of the Mississippi River while the western striped cucumber beetle Acalymma trivittatum is found mostly west of the Mississippi 
cucumber	Spotted cucumber beetles Diabrotica undecimpuctata howardi are about inch long with 12 black spots on their wings . The larvae similar in appearance to the striped cucumber beetles are called southern corn rootworms though their range is throughout the U
cucumber	The banded cucumber beetle Diabrotica balteata is found primarily in southern California 
cucumber	Adult cucumber beetles emerge around midsummer 
cucumber	Because adult cucumber beetles are strong fliers and can be carried long distances up to 500 miles in 3 or 4 days by air currents 3 they can disperse rapidly and travel readily from field to field during the summer 
cucumber	The type of damage and the plant species affected depend on the species of cucumber beetle see Table 1 
cucumber	9 12 Adult cucumber beetles feed on these alternative host crops become infected with bacterial wilt then transmit the disease to squash melons or cucumbers either by feeding on the crop plants or by depositing their feces on wounded leaves or stems . In Pennsylvania large numbers of adult cucumber beetles migrate into the state in the spring and up to 10 percent of these beetles have tested positive for carrying the pathogen that causes bacterial wilt 13 although the carrying capacity can go up to 70 percent in some cases 
cucumber	The spread of the disease decreases as plants mature and cucumber beetle populations decrease in midsummer 
cucumber	Bacterial wilt is severe on cantaloupe and cucumber less damaging on squash and pumpkin and rarely affects watermelon . For example County Fair \xe2\x80\x9983 and Saladin are resistant varieties of cucumber but there are no known resistant varieties of muskmelon 
cucumber	The western striped cucumber beetle and the spotted cucumber beetle are alternate vectors for another disease the squash mosaic virus the primary vector is aphids 
cucumber	Population monitoring is used to determine when overwintering cucumber beetle populations emerge and spring flight begins 
cucumber	Since cucumber beetles like shade examine the undersides of cotyledons young leaves and stems 
cucumber	Crop rotation an important management tool for disease control is ineffective in controlling cucumber beetles since the beetles migrate from areas surrounding the fields 
cucumber	Periodic removal of the covers for hand cultivation however would permit the entry of cucumber beetles 
cucumber	Research conducted in Virginia 28 showed that plastic mulch reduced numbers of cucumber beetles often below the threshold level for pesticide application . The researchers noted that for conventional growers this reflective mulch could reduce the use of insecticides while for organic growers repulsion of cucumber beetles could reduce bacterial wilt transmission . They also noted that the repulsive effect of reflective plastic may also reduce virus transmission by both cucumber beetles and aphids 
cucumber	Cultivation and residue removal can help reduce overwintering populations of cucumber beetles 
cucumber	Most effective as trap crops are species that are highly preferred by cucumber beetles see plants with rankings greater than 45 in Table 2 
cucumber	For organic production apply botanical insecticides to the trap crop to kill cucumber beetles that have gathered 
cucumber	Hoffmann 37 recommends that growers practicing IPM methods use instead oil on a yellow cloth to attack and kill cucumber beetles 
cucumber	Alone it is not effective against adult cucumber beetles . However recent studies Reggie Destree communication indicate that a mixture of neem with karanja oil derived from the tree Pnogania glabra found throughout India can reduce cucumber beetle populations by 50 to 70 percent overnight 
cucumber	As discussed above determining when spring flight begins will enable you to forecast the arrival of cucumber beetles in your area

cucumber	CONTROL SUGGESTION Use resistant varieties whenever possible there are varieties of beans resistant to the bean mosaic viruses and cucumbers resistant to cucumber mosaic be aware that some plants have resistance to virus strains not present in your garden many viruses live in weeds and are carried to the garden by insects especially aphids and leaf hoppers control of insects and removal of weeds will decrease the threat of virus infection use seeds and transplants spacing planting dates often helps prevent virus infections 
cucumber	There are two species of cucumber beetles . Besides cucumbers the flowers and leaves of many other vegetables and flowers may be attacked . Cucumber beetles spread bacterial wilt in cucumbers . Early control of cucumber beetles on cucumbers and melons beginning at plant emergence is necessary to reduce bacterial wilt transmission 
cucumber	If fruits are picked early small plants can bear 35 to 50 cucumbers but if fruits are picked at a large size only five to 12 cucumbers will form on each plant . Old cucumbers prevent plant food from going into the production of new fruit

cucumber	Striped and spotted cucumber beetles can cause serious losses in cucumbers and cantaloupes in Kentucky . Cucumber beetles are a major concern to cantaloupe and cucumber growers because they carry and transmit the bacterium that causes bacterial wilt . This disease can severely limit cucumber and cantaloupe production if it is not managed effectively 
cucumber	Two species of cucumber beetle the striped and the spotted are both effective vectors for bacterial wilt 
cucumber	Lexington during the summer of 2000 to evaluate the effectiveness of a newly registered systemic insecticide and a foliar insecticide for control of cucumber beetles on cantaloupes and their control of bacterial wilt 
cucumber	Between plots 30 ft of corn was transplanted into the rows to reduce cucumber beetle movement 
cucumber	The commercially available cucumber beetle treatments examined were an untreated control Pounce 3 . The drench was selected to minimize exposure of laborers to insecticide residues while trying to maximize rapid uptake of the insecticide and control of cucumber beetles 
cucumber	Prior to harvest cucumber beetle numbers were monitored by periodically recording the number of striped and spotted cucumber beetles on five plants in each plot and by use of a yellow sticky card in the corner of each plot . However in the analysis because cucumber beetles tended to first colonize the outside rows of plots the inner and outer rows of the plot were analyzed separately and then analyzed together 
cucumber	During the course of this study the striped cucumber beetle was far more numerous than the spotted cucumber beetle . Generally numbers of striped cucumber beetles were high in early June but declined through late July . Yellow sticky card monitoring revealed an initial difference in the number of striped cucumber beetles among treatments . During the first two sampling periods many more striped cucumber beetles were captured in untreated plots than in the insecticide treated plots . There was no significant difference in the number of cucumber beetles captured on yellow sticky cards in Admire and plots throughout the study 
cucumber	Numbers of spotted cucumber beetles on the plants were so low that no differences among treatments were detected 
cucumber	Levels of infection were slightly higher in outside rows as might be expected due to manner in which cucumber beetles colonize plots 
cucumber	The evidence provided by this study indicates that a single application of the systemic insecticide Admire when applied at 20 fluid as a drench provided the same level of cucumber beetle control as five weekly foliar applications of Pounce 
cucumber	These data are consistent with our standing recommendations that cucumber beetle control is critical to bacterial wilt control . The levels of cucumber beetle control bacterial wilt infection and melon yields using those other methods may not be the same as those obtained with the soil drench method

cucumber	Among cucurbit vegetables it can be a serious pest on watermelons cucumbers and cantaloupes and to a lesser degree squash and pumpkin 
cucumber	Transmission of nonpersistent viruses such as cucumber mosaic virus can sometimes be reduced by coating the foliage with vegetable or mineral oil 
cucumber	Rootknot nematode populations were the highest in the nontreated control during the first spring cucumber crop and declined after that possibly due to the effects of the prolonged drought . Methyl bromide and Telone C17 reduced populations equally well in all three years of the spring cucumbers 
cucumber	Rotenone is a contact and stomach poison that is effective against insects such as aphids certain beetles asparagus beetle bean leaf beetle Colorado potato beetle cucumber beetle flea beetle strawberry leaf beetle and others and caterpillars as well as fleas and lice on animals 
cucumber	Creeping cucumber Melothria pendula is considered to be an important wild host . The Cucumis species cucumber gerkin and cantaloupe are attacked but not preferred 
cucumber	Pickleworm may damage summer and winter squash cucumber cantaloupe and pumpkin 
cucumber	This approach is probably ineffective for species with small open blossoms such as cucumber however because the nematodes die quickly when exposed to sunlight 
cucumber	nematodes on cucumber Plate 6 . Plants in the cucumber and squash family are some of the most sensitive producing large irregularly shaped galls as shown on the roots of this cucumber 
cucumber	nematodes can infect and reproduce well on roots of peppers but normally form much smaller galls on peppers than on cucumbers and many other susceptible plants 
cucumber	Weekly releases of 1000 individuals per ha have been extremely effective for controlling spider mites on tomato pepper and cucumber Gillespie et al 
cucumber	Phytophagy has evolved in some Oxytelinae to the point where the diet of adults and larvae of Bledius consists of diatoms and at least one species of Apocellus has been accused of damaging flowers one species of Carpelimus has probably wrongly been accused of damaging cucumbers and one species of Osorius Osoriinae has been accused of damaging turf grass 
cucumber	Of the important vegetables crops grown in Florida Bemisia is a major pest of tomato peppers squash cucumber beans eggplant watermelon and cabbage 
cucumber	Among vegetable crops injured are asparagus bean beet cabbage cantaloupe carrot corn cucumber lettuce onion pea potato rhubarb rutabaga salsify sweet potato tomato turnip and watermelon 
cucumber	Pepo fruit of large size with a tough or very firm and hard outer wall rind which is developed from the receptacle such as Citrullus lanatus watermelon Cucumis sativus cucumber and Cucurbita spp

cucumber	Most commonly cucumbers or watermelons follow tomatoes or peppers but other combinations may occur 
cucumber	Minor and occasional pests include aphids mealybugs avocado leafroller avocado looper banded cucumber beetle caterpillars grasshoppers and 7 
cucumber	In addition to infestations of pepper melon thrips can easily increase on subsequent plantings of eggplant cucumber potato beans and watermelon which are also susceptible to damage from this pest 
cucumber	Minor and occasional pests include squash bug stink bugs squash vine borer southern armyworm banded cucumber beetle and twospotted spider mite . Insects and mites that may occasionally be seen on cantaloupe but are not economically damaging include garden fleahoppers fruit flies spotted cucumber beetle striped cucumber beetle potato leafhopper broad mite leaffooted bug western flower thrips sweetpotato whitefly greenhouse whitefly cutworms ants cabbage looper field crickets other armyworms fall armyworm beet armyworm yellowstriped armyworm flea beetles grasshoppers lygus bugs saltmarsh caterpillar squash beetle tobacco budworm and wireworms 
cucumber	The preferred genus is Cucurbita squash and pumpkin but Cucumis species cantaloupe and cucumber are also attacked 
cucumber	Several viruses common to cucurbit plants are cucumber mosaic virus watermelon mosaic virus 2 and zucchini yellow mosaic virus 
cucumber	Its occurrence also depends somewhat on the presence of wild cucurbit species such as creeping cucumber Melothria pendula balsam apple Clusia rosea and ivy gourd Coccinea grandis that serve as the primary hosts . These insects can spread PRSVW from other cucurbit crops watermelon squash and cucumber as well as the weed hosts 37

cucumber	It is one of the most important aphid virus vectors and can transmit over 100 plant viruses including those that affect celery in Florida cucumber mosaic virus and celery mosaic virus 
cucumber	Florida produces approximately of the country cucumbers for the fresh market and approximately half of the fall season cucumbers . Florida produces no cucumbers for the summer market . Nearly 60 percent of the state cucumber crop is produced during the spring production season and approximately 40 percent during the fall . About half of Florida s cucumber crop is sold in April and May with a smaller peak in sales during November and December 
cucumber	There are three types of cucumbers produced in Florida . Slicing cucumbers are usually used uncooked in salads although younger fruits may occasionally be pickled . Approximately 98 percent or more of the slicing type of cucumbers are produced for the fresh market . Most pickling cucumbers are sold on contract and are shipped to pickling processors although a significant amount of the crop may be sold on the fresh market . Pickling cultivars sold fresh are becoming more common in grocery stores but sales of pickling cucumbers remains a minor portion of total sales . Early spring or winter crops bring higher prices for pickling cucumbers sold on the fresh market . The third type of cucumbers produced in Florida European burpless greenhouse cucumbers are all sold fresh marketed as a premium product in grocery stores in Florida and the eastern states 
cucumber	Greenhouse production of cucumbers in Florida continues from approximately September to June 
cucumber	All greenhouse cucumbers are European burpless a seedless type that does not require pollination . Nearly all greenhouse production of cucumbers in Florida uses bag culture with perlite as the medium . Rockwool may also be used as an alternative medium and it produces the same results as perlite in terms of cucumber yield 13 
cucumber	When cucumber is planted as a second crop in the winter following a fall crop of tomato pepper or eggplant the plastic mulch may be painted black before planting cucumbers . However if cucumbers are planted in March or April growers will leave the plastic mulch white . On winter cucumber grown as a second crop some growers use herbicides to kill the first crop leaving the debris to protect the second crop from cold and winds . When cucumbers are planted after tomatoes about 20 percent of the growers leave the stakes and string as a trellis for the cucumber plants to climb 21 
cucumber	In Palm Beach County a pepper and cucumber system is common . After the pepper crop is produced using fumigated plastic mulch with seepage irrigation the same plastic mulch is used for the cucumber crop provided that it is in satisfactory condition . Manatee County growers also commonly grow cucumber in a following pepper or tomato . As a result many of the cucumbers are produced with drip irrigation 10 . In the northern regions of the state about of the cucumber crop is grown on open ground 
cucumber	Critical periods for adequate soil moisture in cucumber include seed germination flowering and the fruiting period 
cucumber	On cucumber grown without polyethylene mulch up to of the nitrogen and potassium fertilizer are applied at planting with the remainder banded in split applications early in the season . On a first crop of mulched cucumber fertilizer timing and placement depend on the type of irrigation system used 
cucumber	Crop nutrient requirements for cucumbers in Florida have been determined based on studies conducted by researchers at the University of Florida Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences . The cucumber crop requires 90 pounds per acre of nitrogen and 120 pounds per acre each of phosphate and potassium 
cucumber	Except for greenhouse varieties cucumbers require insect pollination for fruit development to occur 
cucumber	All cucumbers in Florida are harvested by hand several times . Pickling cucumbers must be harvested every three to four days or they will be oversized . For slicing cucumbers the number of pickings is largely determined by market price . of cucumbers requires approximately 150 per acre for the season 
cucumber	After reaching the packinghouse the cucumbers are washed in a dump tank and lifted from there into the packinghouse to be sorted and graded . The price of pickling cucumbers is related to the fruit size higher prices are received for smaller cucumbers . After sorting and grading pickling cucumbers are then placed into pallet bins for shipment to the processor . Since cucumbers are highly susceptible to dessication those destined for the fresh market are waxed prior to packing . Most greenhouse cucumbers are with polyethylene film . The most common packing container for cucumbers is a bushel or 1 and bushel 
cucumber	Insect pests generally do not inflict very serious damage to cucumbers in Florida but they are a serious concern for the grower because the very low tolerance for insect damage in the crop makes strict insect control necessary particularly for pickling cucumbers . Diseases on Florida cucumbers are less significant than on other vegetable crops principally because of the availability of resistant cultivars . Weeds also do not present a significant problem because most cucumbers are grown as second crops on plastic mulch . Cucumbers are highly susceptible to nematodes which may cause more problems for cucumber growers in the absence of effective alternatives to methyl bromide 
cucumber	Since cucumber is often grown as a second crop following tomato eggplant or pepper using plastic mulch production much of Florida cucumber crop has received the effects of methyl bromide applied to the first crop . Although there is no residual methyl bromide in the soil the substantial reduction in populations of nematodes disease pathogens and weeds during the first crop usually permits cucumber production to be completed before soil pest populations increase enough to become a problem . Diseases such as and Fusarium wilt are therefore likely to increase on Florida cucumbers with the impending of methyl bromide 17 
cucumber	A model analyzing the impact of the loss of methyl bromide on Florida vegetable production predicts that overall cucumber production in Florida will decline by 46 percent . Southwest Florida production of cucumbers with tomatoes is expected to increase 17 
cucumber	The last reported use of chloropicrin on cucumbers in Florida was in 1990 when growers applied an average of 51 pounds of active ingredient per acre one time to 7 percent of their processed cucumber acreage . Total usage on cucumbers in that year was pounds of active ingredient 30 
cucumber	Solarization was compared to use of methyl bromide in southeast Florida Palm Beach County on a of bell peppers and cucumber . However when a second crop of cucumbers was planted after the peppers the effects of the solarization did not carry over as well as did the effects of methyl bromide in comparative plots 
cucumber	Management of insect pests is vital in cucumber production since shipments can be rejected if small amounts of insect damage are found particularly from pickleworm . In north Florida fall plantings of cucumbers generally suffer greater insect attack than spring plantings while in south Florida insect problems are usually greater in the spring . The most troublesome insect pest on cucumbers in Florida is the pickleworm . Minor arthropod pests on cucumber include melon thrips leafminers banded cucumber beetle aphids armyworms mole crickets and cutworms . Flea beetles mites stink bugs wireworms grasshoppers leafhoppers squash bug squash vine borer and loopers may occasionally damage cucumber but are generally not a concern for the commercial grower . In greenhouse production of cucumbers in Florida whiteflies are the principal insect pest 
cucumber	Pickleworm although well managed by Florida cucumber growers is one of the most important insect pests because of the low tolerance for feeding damage on the crop . Processors of pickling cucumbers reject entire loads when very low numbers are detected 
cucumber	While potentially a devastating pest cucumber growers in Florida are presently able to maintain good control of pickleworm and other lepidopterous larvae 
cucumber	Melonworm is mainly a problem in the southern part of the state and is not as damaging to cucumber as pickleworm . In addition to cucumber preferred plants include cantaloupe squash and pumpkin 40 
cucumber	Whiteflies damage cucumber plants by removing plant sap with their mouthparts depleting the plant of needed nutrients and resulting in poor growth . In cucumber plant growth is completely stunted by an average whitefly population density of 30 nymphs per square inch of leaf 
cucumber	Thrips are occasionally a major pest on cucumbers in Florida particularly in south Florida . Since then it has caused large economic losses in several vegetable crops in south Florida particularly in cucumber snap beans peppers eggplant winter melon and squash 
cucumber	Leafminers are another minor pest of cucumber in Florida 
cucumber	Where cucumber is grown on plastic mulched beds leafminer pupae can be seen on the surface of the plastic 48 
cucumber	Cucumber Beetles banded cucumber beetle Diabrotica balteata striped cucumber beetle Acalymma vittatum and spotted cucumber beetle D . Cucumber beetles mainly banded and occasionally spotted and striped are minor pests on cucumbers in Florida . Banded cucumber beetle is more common in south Florida while spotted cucumber beetle is more common in the northern regions of the state . Striped cucumber beetle is seen only occasionally primarily in western and northern Florida 
cucumber	Banded cucumber beetle prefers beans and soybeans but in addition to cucumbers also damages squash beets peas sweet potatoes okra corn lettuce onion and cabbage among other vegetables as well as many weeds 
cucumber	In addition to direct feeding some aphids cause damage to cucumber plants by transmitting potyviruses that affect cucumbers in Florida especially the watermelon strain of papaya ringspot virus and watermelon mosaic virus 2 . Therefore aphid vectors that do not feed on cucumber may move from plant to plant within a field probing each one and spreading the virus . Aphids that do feed and reproduce on cucumber may also move from one plant to another within the field under crowded conditions when winged individuals are produced 
cucumber	Cutworms the most common of which on cucumber in Florida is the granulate cutworm are stout caterpillars with a dark greasy appearance 
cucumber	Mole crickets are a minor pest on cucumbers in Florida principally affecting seedlings . The main damage to cucumber plants from mole crickets is from the tunnels made around the root system 
cucumber	is one of the most important insecticides for Florida cucumber growers who use it every year primarily in the management of pickleworm and melonworm 
cucumber	On processed cucumbers in Florida last reported use was in 1990 when growers applied an average of 1 . times to 29 percent of their processed cucumber acreage . Total usage on processed cucumbers in that year was pounds of active ingredient 30 
cucumber	A number of new insecticides have been introduced for cucumber 
cucumber	Cucumber growers in Florida commonly kill the pests from a first crop of tomato or eggplant and wait as long as possible before planting cucumbers . Finally crop rotation is practiced by most cucumber growers in Florida . Within any given year cucumbers are rotated with fruiting vegetables such as tomato pepper and eggplant 16 
cucumber	Early planting of spring cucumber crops aids in avoiding buildup of melonworm and pickleworm populations since their numbers increase throughout the season . Squash is highly preferable to the moths who will lay their eggs on the squash plants instead of on cucumber . Planting four to eight rows of squash per acre of cucumber is recommended with several successive plantings to provide a continuous supply of squash fruit to the moths . The pests must be destroyed on the trap crop before they become fully grown or their food supply is depleted and they move onto the cucumber plants 39 
cucumber	In greenhouse tests the fungus Paecilomyces fumosoroseus a native strain of which was found to be highly effective in managing whiteflies and other pests killed more than 70 percent of whitefly nymphs on several host plants including cucumber 
cucumber	Beneficial organisms also naturally control some of the other pests of cucumber in Florida 
cucumber	There are many diseases that can affect cucumbers grown in Florida and disease problems can sometimes be serious . However diseases on cucumbers in Florida are generally well managed with resistant varieties and a combination of other tactics . Diseases tend to affect fall cucumber crops in the state to a greater extent than spring plantings . Common diseases affecting cucumbers in Florida include target spot caused by Corynespora cassiicola downy mildew caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis powdery mildrew caused by Sphaerotheca fuliginea and Erysiphe cichoracearum gummy stem blight caused by Mycosphaerella citrullina Phytophthora blight caused by Phytophthora capsici watermelon mosaic viruses belly rot caused by Rhizoctonia solani angular leaf spot caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv lachrymans anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum lagenarium Glomerella cingulata and cottony leak caused by Pythium aphanidermatum . Diseases that present a problem less commonly on cucumbers in the state include caused by Pythium spp 
cucumber	Gummy stem blight commonly affects cucumbers in greenhouse production to a greater extent than in field production . Additionally Botrytis blight caused by Botrytis cinerea can be a problem in greenhouse cucumber production as can Pythium root rot caused by Pythium aphanidermatum sclerotinia stem rot caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum cucumber mosaic virus and downy mildew 
cucumber	Target spot is the most important disease for cucumber growers in Florida . It is potentially a problem every year and it can seriously damage the cucumber crop . The disease affects approximately 20 percent of the cucumber acreage in Florida and probably causes up to 10 percent yield loss 
cucumber	Target spot was first reported in Florida in 1967 on cucumber in the Immokalee area . The disease is first apparent on cucumber leaves as small yellow flecks which later become angular and tan to light brown in color surrounded by darker brown edges 
cucumber	Downy mildew occurs on cucumbers every year throughout Florida but it does not seriously affect production due to the availability of resistant varieties . In south Florida it is more severe on cucumbers planted in the fall and spring than on those planted in the winter and it may affect fall and spring planted cucumber as early as the first true leaf stage 
cucumber	Powdery mildew is also commonly seen on cucumbers but it is a minor problem for Florida growers because cultivars with good resistance are available 68 . In addition to cucumbers powdery mildew caused by several species of fungus attacks beans southern pea okra squash muskmelon honeydew pumpkin strawberry and watermelon in Florida 
cucumber	Gummy stem blight frequently infects cucumbers in Florida 76 . In greenhouse production of cucumbers it poses a greater problem than in outdoor production 3 
cucumber	On cucumber it produces angular lesions and a rapidly developing fruit rot that becomes covered with a white fungal mat 78 . In Manatee County 41 percent of cucumber plants in some surveyed fields were found to have the disease 77 
cucumber	Mosaic Viruses Papaya ringspot virus type W watermelon mosaic virus 2 cucumber mosaic virus and zucchini yellow mosaic virus . Viruses are less of a problem on cucumber in Florida than on watermelon and squash . Cucumber mosaic virus and zucchini yellow mosaic virus are considered minor diseases on cucumber in the state . The viruses that affect cucumber in Florida are transmitted by aphids which can acquire them from a number of crop and weed hosts . bur cucumber Sicyos sp . citroides creeping cucumber Melothria sp . may each serve as a host to at least one of the viruses that affect cucumbers in the state . However papaya ringspot virus type W and zucchini yellow mosaic virus are much more restricted in their host ranges than watermelon mosaic virus 2 and cucumber mosaic virus 
cucumber	Angular leaf spot occurs occasionally on cucumber in Florida appearing approximately once every four years 
cucumber	Cottony leak was a major problem on Florida cucumber in the past . Cottony leak may also develop as a disease while cucumbers are in transit in which case it can spread easily from fruit to fruit 70 
cucumber	The same and similar fungi that cause cottony leak on field grown cucumbers also causes Pythium root rot on greenhouse grown cucumbers 
cucumber	Although used on processed cucumbers in Florida detailed mancozeb data are available only for 1990 when growers applied an average of 1 . times each to 52 percent of their processed cucumber acreage . Total usage on processed cucumbers in that year was pounds of active ingredient 30 
cucumber	Although used on processed cucumbers in Florida detailed copper hydroxide data are available only for 1990 when growers applied an average of 0 . times to 36 percent of their processed cucumber acreage . Total usage on processed cucumbers in that year was 500 pounds of active ingredient 30 
cucumber	A few new fungicides have been introduced for cucumber 
cucumber	The development of resistant cultivars has been the most important component of disease management on Florida cucumbers 
cucumber	In addition to the use of resistant cultivars cucumber growers in Florida make an effort to use clean seed particularly to avoid angular leaf spot 
cucumber	Water management is another important component of diseases management in cucumbers 
cucumber	Additional recommendations for cucumber disease management include the removal of crop and weed residues for the management of belly rot and gummy stem blight the removal of weeds around cucumber fields to reduce virus incidence and crop rotation 
cucumber	Cultural tactics for management of cucumber diseases in the greenhouse include the use of transplants which reduces Pythium root rot 
cucumber	diseases are occasionally a problem in cucumber production in Florida particularly soft rot and cottony leak 85 
cucumber	nematodes are the principal nematode pest of cucumbers in Florida . Galls from nematodes attacking cucumbers are approximately to inch 0
cucumber	On processed cucumbers in Florida use of oxamyl has been reported only for 1994 when growers applied an average of 0 . times each to 35 percent of their processed cucumber acreage . Total usage on processed cucumber in that year was pounds of active ingredient 28 
cucumber	In production systems resurgence of nematodes late in the cucumber season can be a problem even with the use of methyl bromide . However none of the alternative fumigants was as effective as methyl bromide in terms of cucumber plant vigor root galling and yield 19 
cucumber	Nematode populations on cucumbers have been found to be reduced when the cucumber crop is preceded by a tomato cultivar 86 . There are no cucumber cultivars available commercially 
cucumber	Weeds compete with cucumber plants for light moisture and nutrients and can interfere with harvest operations 
cucumber	Common weeds in Florida cucumber production include nutsedges crabgrass goosegrass Texas panicum bristly starbur Florida pusley and purslane . Since most cucumbers in Florida are grown as a second crop with plastic mulch weeds are not presently a major problem in cucumber 
cucumber	In 2000 Florida growers applied herbicides totaling 200 pounds of active ingredient to 5 percent of the state cucumber acreage . During the years in which usage data have been collected between 5 and 60 percent of cucumber acreage has been treated with herbicides each year with total annual usage ranging from 200 to pounds of active ingredient . On processed cucumbers Florida growers applied herbicides to 40 percent of their acreage in 1994 with total usage of 800 pounds of active ingredient in that year 
cucumber	4 pounds of active ingredient per application to 5 percent of their cucumber acreage once per season . During 5 of the 6 years in which usage data have been collected cucumber growers in Florida have applied paraquat at an average rate ranging from 0 . 7 pounds of active ingredient per treated acre at each application to between 5 and 46 percent of their cucumber acreage 
cucumber	On processed cucumbers in Florida last reported use of paraquat was in 1990 when growers applied an average of 0 . times each to 41 percent of their processed cucumber acreage . Total paraquat usage on processed cucumbers in that year was 800 pounds of active ingredient 30 
cucumber	Use of glyphosate on cucumbers in Florida was last reported in 1990 when growers applied an average of 1 . time each to 18 percent of their cucumber acreage . Total glyphosate use on cucumbers in that year was pounds of active ingredient 30 
cucumber	On processed cucumbers in Florida last reported use was also in 1990 when growers applied an average of 0 . times each to 29 percent of their processed cucumber acreage . Total glyphosate usage on processed cucumbers in that year was 500 pounds of active ingredient 30 
cucumber	Nutsedge is the only weed able to grow through the polyethylene mulch commonly used in cucumber production in Florida . Researchers in Florida have been evaluating alternatives that can control nutsedge and have found that the herbicide is able to control nutsedge at specific times during the production of cucumber and all other cucurbits except squash 18 
cucumber	A combination of cultural tactics is recommended for adequate weed management in cucumber production . Mechanical control including preplant plowing or disking of the field and cultivation during the season is an important component of weed management for Florida cucumber producers . However after planting most growers do not cultivate between the rows because of the narrow row spacing in cucumbers . Polyethylene mulch used by most cucumber growers acts as a barrier to the growth of weeds inhibiting the development of all weeds except nutsedge 
cucumber	Eggplant can be grown and are often double cropped with pepper or cucumber following eggplant harvest . Growers in Florida often put eggplant in as an extra crop and grow okra squash or cucumbers after the eggplant has been harvested 5 
cucumber	In the past few years this insect has become a significant pest of eggplant cucumber squash succulent bean tomato and sweet potato in south Florida 
cucumber	Under experimental rearing conditions whiteflies developed significantly faster on eggplant than on tomato sweet potato cucumber or succulent bean 
cucumber	These insects are present throughout the growing season and have a very broad host range including eggplant celery spinach lettuce melons cucumber pumpkin okra tomato pepper potato and carrot 24 
cucumber	Although a crop profile does not currently exist for banana key insects identified for banana include mealybugs thrips and a cucumber beetle in that order 
cucumber	Achoccha is also called wild cucumber caihua and korila . However it is unlike the viny plant known as wild cucumber in Florida a weed pest in lawns and around the home with miniature leaves and fruits 
cucumber	Fruits produced in Mexico and the Caribbean resemble hollow cucumbers 
cucumber	Tomatoes cucumbers lettuce and peppers probably account for the vast majority of all vegetables produced commercially in greenhouses 
cucumber	An initial reaction to this might be if we can successfully produce tomato cucumber lettuce and peppers then certainly we can produce other types of vegetables 
cucumber	Dutch type cucumbers Cucumis sativus also called European or English cucumbers the long thin skinned seedless cucumbers available in most grocery stores are one of the major greenhouse crops grown in Florida . Beit Alpha cucumbers are similar in appearance and production to Dutch cucumbers and trials indicate that they can be produced just as successfully in Florida 
cucumber	Beit Alpha cucumbers can be produced in any greenhouse suitable for production of Dutch type cucumbers . For best production of either type of cucumber the greenhouse should have high enough sidewalls to allow good air movement around the plants . Dutch cucumbers prefer a temperature range of F while Beit Alpha cucumbers are more tolerant of both low and high temperatures F . F while Beit Alpha cucumbers are more tolerant of both low and high temperatures F 
cucumber	Both types of cucumbers can be produced in perlite organic media such as pine bark or coconut coir or mixes of organic media and perlite 
cucumber	Biological methods of control are available and effective for some of the insects and diseases affecting greenhouse cucumbers 
cucumber	Beit Alpha cucumbers should be harvested at a diameter of 1 . The minimum length at harvest of Dutch type cucumbers is 11 inches but Beit Alpha fruit will be approximately half the length of Dutch type cultivars at an equivalent harvest stage 
cucumber	Dutch cucumbers are in plastic after harvest to prevent damage to the skin and water loss . The thicker skins of the Beit Alpha cucumbers while still thin enough to not require peeling are better able to survive postharvest handling and marketing . Preliminary local marketing tests showed that the Beit Alpha cucumbers were well received by the Florida consumer 
cucumber	The flavor is somewhat like a cucumber yet different 
cucumber	Chayote is a tender cucurbit with climbing vines and leaves resembling those of the cucumber 
cucumber	Imports of fresh peppers tomatoes cucumbers and melons into the United States from Mexico declined in 1999 
cucumber	In Almeria Spain vegetables are generally grown as two types of crops which are called winter crops such as tomato pepper cucumber and certain squashes and summer crops such as various muskmelons watermelons and green beans . The production peaks are wherein tomato cucumber green beans and pepper are harvested and then again in where many of melons especially melons are harvested . In the Netherlands tomato sweet pepper and cucumber are the most important vegetable crops 
cucumber	There are no legal disease control products for either herb or lettuce production in the greenhouse and only one for cucumber production 
cucumber	Presently there appears to be a good market for greenhouse tomatoes and a fair but more volatile market for cucumbers herbs peppers and lettuce 
cucumber	More recently cucumbers popular in the Middle East are becoming popular here . In general cucumbers are slightly more difficult to grow than tomatoes because of the lack of disease resistance and the paucity of pest control chemicals . Greenhouse cucumbers are trellised and pruned and like tomatoes the vines achieve great lengths in a mature crop . Unlike tomatoes greenhouse cucumbers require no pollination . This is because these types of cucumbers are parthenocarpic producing fruit without pollination . In fact the greenhouse cucumber grower will need to ensure that bees carrying cucumber pollen from a field cucumber crop do not enter the greenhouse . Otherwise the greenhouse cucumbers will develop seeds and will be unmarketable . Greenhouse European cucumbers require of each fruit in order to market them . Therefore greenhouse cucumber growers will need to purchase or have access to a machine 
cucumber	Armenian cucumber is closely related to muskmelon but is elongated like a cucumber 
cucumber	Seeds are more like those of a muskmelon than a cucumber 
cucumber	In Florida as in most parts of the country the Armenian cucumber is grown as a curiosity and for pickling 
cucumber	Follow the cultural suggestions for cucumber and cantaloupe 
cucumber	There is a high risk of losing cucumber crops by flooding of low elevation marl soils 
cucumber	Typically cucumber beds are inches wide inches high and spaced 6 ft between the centers of adjacent beds 
cucumber	To allow sufficient time for the fumigant to dissipate completely cucumber seedlings should not be transplanted into the fumigated bed until at least a week after application of the fumigant 
cucumber	Drip irrigation systems are used for cucumber production in County 
cucumber	Researchers at Auburn University have shown that certain biologicals altered the level of cucurbitacins in cucumbers and thereby made them less to cucumber beetles . This biochemical phenomenon also reduced the amount of cucurbit wilt pathogen transmitted by the cucumber beetle apparently due to its reduced feeding 
cucumber	Eggplant can be rotated with tomato cucumber okra watermelon squash cucumber watermelon cantaloupe specialty vegetables and herbs 
cucumber	These crops include tomato pepper eggplant strawberry and cucurbits including watermelon muskmelon squash and cucumber 
cucumber	Emitter spacings on the order of 9 to 12 inches are optimum for close spaced crops such as peppers strawberries squash cucumbers muskmelons and cole crops 
cucumber	Tomatoes generally tolerate higher salt conditions than cucumbers peppers or lettuce 
cucumber	Plants are pruned to a single stem and can be supported on a nylon net trellis 6 in x 6 in openings or with twine and plastic clips as in greenhouse cucumber production 
cucumber	In North America most commercial producers are located in the northern United States and in Canada where growers raise lettuce tomatoes cucumbers and other crops primarily for spring and summer markets 
cucumber	West Indian gherkin is also known as burr cucumber Jerusalem cucumber and erroneously gooseberry gourd . It is related to the cucumber which it resembles in many aspects such as fruit and vine characteristics 
cucumber	Gherkin is grown occasionally in home gardens throughout Florida in a manner similar to that for cucumber 
cucumber	Each fruit is filled with tiny seeds shaped like those from cucumber 
cucumber	myriocarpus and horned cucumber C
cucumber	Horned cucumbers are larger than the other two measuring 5 inches long by 3 inches in diameter 
cucumber	Smooth luffa fruits are shaped like cucumbers but are larger feet in length and inches thick 
cucumber	Prepare the soil and fertilize just as you would for squash or cucumbers 
cucumber	Small less than 6 inches long young luffa gourds are used as a vegetable either prepared like squash or eaten raw like cucumbers 
cucumber	Also it is used raw like sliced cucumbers 
cucumber	Several different types of production systems and substrates can be used to grow greenhouse cucumbers 
cucumber	Greenhouse cucumbers are ordinarily established in the greenhouse as transplants using rockwool or foam blocks . Some growers have successfully direct seeded cucumber into perlite bags and at the same time seeded a few transplants to use as replacement plants 
cucumber	There are many cultivars available for greenhouse cucumber production . Diseases that can be problems in greenhouse cucumbers in Florida include gummy stem blight gray mold downy mildew powdery mildew cucumber mosaic watermelon mosaic and Pythium root rot in NFT 
cucumber	In addition to the standard long European cucumbers special markets may also be developed for shorter miniature or types . Some miniature cucumber cultivars are especially susceptible to powdery mildew and the tolerance level of each cultivar should be checked 
cucumber	Several training systems exist for greenhouse cucumber 
cucumber	Greenhouse seedless cucumbers have a high nutrient requirement and grow very rapidly when supplied with sufficient nutrients 
cucumber	Many of the guidelines for soilless culture of tomato presented earlier in this handbook also apply to cucumber 
cucumber	Several research articles report a sudden temporary wilt of greenhouse cucumber plants when using NFT 
cucumber	Several diseases insects and nematodes can potentially be pests of greenhouse cucumbers . The pest control portion of this handbook has details for managing pests of greenhouse cucumbers 
cucumber	Continued timely harvest keeps the plants in a productive mode since cucumber plants have a limit to the number of fruits they can support any instance 
cucumber	European greenhouse cucumbers have a very thin skin resulting in high susceptibility to water loss and softening of harvested fruit . Since each cucumber has to be shrink wrapped this crop is very and time consuming . Growers often mention they were not aware of the considerable time needed to properly greenhouse cucumbers . Growers should invest in a commercial machine designed for cucumbers so that the shrink wrapping is done in a professional manner 
cucumber	European greenhouse cucumbers are considered highly susceptible to chilling injury caused by exposure to low but nonfreezing temperatures . Chilling injury on cucumber fruit results in a pitting of the fruit surface and a tendency for more rapid loss of green color 
cucumber	When cucumber fruits are exposed to ethylene they lose cholorophyll and rapidly become yellow . Chilling injury to cucumber fruit even for a short duration will increase the production of ethylene by the fruit . It is very important that cucumbers not be held or shipped in the same compartment with moderate to high ethylene producing fruits or vegetables such as tomatoes cantaloupes apples and peaches 
cucumber	In particular several vegetable crops including cucumbers lettuce and tomatoes respond consistently well to carbon dioxide enrichment 
cucumber	A lower level 800ppm is recommended for raising seedlings tomatoes cucumbers and peppers as well as for lettuce production 
cucumber	A number of commodities including cucumber eggplant watermelon okra early potato summer squash and sweetpotato have temperature requirements similar to those of tomatoes but because of their sensitivity to ethylene these commodities should never be transported or stored with tomatoes 
cucumber	Examples of crops are pepper cucumber squash and eggplant which should be stored no colder than 50oF 10oC 
cucumber	Cucurbits such as cucumbers and squash are generally in the field because this method is often more than using transplants 
cucumber	Cucumbers can be transplanted into growing bags however cucumbers also can be seeded directly into the perlite bags . The germination percentage of cucumber seeds is good enough that can result in near 100 stands . Growers might wish to start about 5 of their cucumber crop in transplants so that plants that fail to emerge and develop can be replaced with a growing transplant 
cucumber	Leaching rate for cucumber might need to be 20 
cucumber	Tomatoes can tolerate fairly high soluble salt content in the root zone cucumbers are less tolerant 
cucumber	Water systems can be employed to reduce injury when transferring the tomatoes and cucumbers to the packing line however the water should be chlorinated to reduce populations of decay organisms 
cucumber	Ice should never be applied to cucumbers tomatoes and peppers to avoid development of chilling injury

cucumber	Both species feed on cucumbers tomatoes and lettuce 
cucumber	Spider mites are particularly damaging to tomatoes and cucumbers . Although it is often hard to determine specific economic damage thresholds under all conditions and crop prices research has established some good guidelines for damage indexes for cucumbers and tomatoes 
cucumber	On cucumbers slightly less than 12 mites per square inch will start causing crop losses . For example in a glasshouse test involving cucumbers mites increased from 12 to approximately 107 per square inch in 12 days 
cucumber	Sprinkle irrigation of cucumbers has been used effectively to prevent spider mite populations from increasing when the sprinklers were activated more than 30 times on hot afternoons 
cucumber	They feed on a wide variety of vegetable crops and weeds including tomatoes cucumbers and lettuce 
cucumber	They also cause cucumbers to be curved and hooked . Thrips can reduce cucumber yields by 50 
cucumber	Research on cucumbers shows that daily misting and a relative humidity of 90 or higher reduces thrips and spider mite populations . More cucumbers were produced in misted tests and there were no problems with plant diseases 
cucumber	These pests are associated mainly with tomatoes cucumbers and lettuce 
cucumber	Although numerous caterpillar species may feed on tomatoes cucumbers and lettuce the following are most likely to be encountered in the greenhouse corn earworm also known as the tomato fruitworm cabbage looper armyworms beet southern and yellowstriped and hornworms tomato and tobacco

mushroom	Baez students had been conducting crop surveys in a large field and counting mushrooms during successive months of the growing season . Plotting their collective data on a graph and visually introducing a line they developed a prediction of the number of mushrooms that would be available at the end of his hibernation 
mushroom	As they inventoried the mushrooms the children took note of the underlying terrain and later developed separate graph lines for each type 
mushroom	In the Snookerpuss Adventure we used only one of the nine regions and created eight different configurations populated by varying numbers of mushrooms reflecting a time series over eight simulated months during the growing season 
mushroom	In the Snookerpuss Adventure there were two types of activities scouting reconnaissance enacted by a group of four students at the outset of the unit and data collection mushroom counting enacted by seven groups of two or three students during different simulated months 
mushroom	They noted the different terrain types and the presence of the mushrooms and some ancillary plants 
mushroom	In class the children had discussed the kind of data to be collected and had developed a data table consisting of three labeled cells one each for rocks grass and sand within which they would make tally marks as they encountered mushrooms 
mushroom	In the whole class setting the children had discussed traversal algorithms for ensuring a complete count see next section and had decided to use the flags as a means of ensuring that individual mushrooms were not accidentally recorded more than once 
mushroom	While the field as a whole was too large to use naked eye observations to spot the mushrooms this strategy was more effective in the smaller regions 
mushroom	collaboration was situated at two points during the unit first in the setting the research question and planning of the exploration and later in the aggregation and analysis of data leading to a prediction of mushroom count based on linear interpolation 
mushroom	Some students suggested maintaining a list with each item in the list being the type of terrain in which mushrooms were found but that we later rejected in favor of the tally system with labeled cells 
mushroom	The scouts had reported that the field was too large for them to simply look around and see all the mushrooms and the children recognized they would need to develop a traversal strategy 
mushroom	With the teacher guidance they agreed that a single line which was kind of in the middle of all the points in the words of one student would let them predict mushroom populations into the future 
mushroom	The Snookerpuss needed exactly 34 mushrooms to satisfy his appetite so in spite of the individual differences the class remained confident that there would be enough mushrooms when he awoke . The students also noted the differences in the growth rates by terrain several of them talked about how some of the lines were steeper than the others like on a hill and there was strong agreement that the grass was the best place for mushrooms to grow and if you ran out of room on the grass then you should plant them in the sand . When the checking group returned with an actual count of 36 mushrooms in October Figure 6 a cheer arose from the class 
mushroom	At the classroom tier it was impossible for any individual group to predict the outcome the October mushroom count without the information provided by other groups 
mushroom	How did children make sense of this activity was it a game or was it a math lesson or was it a field The fourth graders in this class were happy to suspend disbelief and the language of both the small groups and the classrooms was of fields mushrooms and the Snookerpuss and not of glasses keyboards or screens 
mushroom	Only a single sector and only a single species of plant the mushrooms were employed . The students investigated the differential growth rates of the mushrooms based on the soil type grass sand rock and tried to predict how many mushrooms would grow by the end of the season . This was important to the students because mushrooms are the favorite cuisine of the Snookerpuss a mysterious creature that hibernates during the summer and wakes in the fall . The students needed to find out if there would be enough mushrooms available when the Snookerpuss awoke so it would need to find other food such as 4th graders 
mushroom	The class was broken up into teams where each team visited the field in a different virtual month June July etc and counted the number of mushrooms growing on each soil type 
mushroom	After introducing a line they predicted of the number of mushrooms that would be available at the end of the Snookerpuss hibernation . From the graphs they also concluded that the mushrooms grew most rapidly in the grass and recommended that next year the mushroom spores be distributed in grassy areas to maximize the yield

mushroom	In this case this is the cap of the mushroom which is the typical identifier of the fly agaric mushroom while Laurel is violently allergic to fungi herself she has done some mushroom gathering . By the same token in the case of Hieronymus the Sarabite cited on the letter of intent the same mushroom enflamed Or was returned for insufficient contrast because the stem faded entirely into the Or flames making it difficult to identify the charge as a mushroom at all as opposed to a poorly drawn gules center to a conventional flame proper . In any case White Stag errs in stating that complete difference of charge should be accorded two different types of mushroom proper unless the tinctures are completely different only a weak minor point could be derived . In this case that can not be done since the mushroom on the device of William MacBruithin the Wilde is gules Sable a sharpened wooden stake bendwise sinister surmounted by a mushroom proper

However as fungi mushrooms have life cycles very different from those of green plants . Oyster mushrooms which grow on many substrates are easiest for a beginner . Shiitake mushrooms already have earned considerable consumer demand . Only two mycorrhizal mushrooms morels and truffles have been commercially cultivated . A careful analysis of potential markets must be the first step in deciding whether to raise mushrooms to sell 
mushroom	A careful analysis of potential markets must be the first step in deciding whether to raise mushrooms to sell 
mushroom	mushroom production represents an opportunity for farmers interested in an additional enterprise and is a specialty option for farmers without much land . This publication is designed for market gardeners who want to incorporate mushrooms into their systems and for those farmers who want to use mushroom cultivation as a way to extract value from woodlot thinnings and other waste materials 
mushroom	Asian traditions maintain that some specialty mushrooms provide health benefits . Two recent books Medicinal Mushrooms An Exploration of Tradition Healing and Culture and Medicinal Mushrooms You Can Grow detail existing research on the health benefits of mushrooms 
mushroom	Specialty mushrooms are not a get rich quick enterprise 
mushroom	The part of the organism that we see and call a mushroom is really just the fruiting body . This is the main body of the mushroom 
mushroom	If you are considering mushroom production become thoroughly familiar with the life cycles of fungi 
mushroom	Most available markets however require more mushrooms than occasional fruiting provides . However indoor mushroom production demands a much higher level of knowledge continuous monitoring and timely manipulation of environmental conditions 
mushroom	The substrate on which the mushrooms will fruit must be sterilized or pasteurized in order to destroy any fungal bacterial competitors 
mushroom	Society of San Francisco has written an excellent article that can help the beginner who is put off by the technical aspects of mushroom cultivation 
mushroom	Many mushroom suppliers sell several kinds of spawn and the beginning mushroom farmer should take advantage of this selection in early trials to determine which species grow best on available materials 
mushroom	Paul Stamets of Fungi Perfecti an educational and mushroom supply company See Resources has spent most of his life studying the growth and cultivation of fungi . His book Growing Gourmet Medicinal Mushrooms see Resources is an invaluable resource for anyone considering the cultivation of any mushroom species . He describes several alternative methods of producing mushrooms including growing them outdoors on logs on stumps and in the garden as well as indoors in bags or on columns 
mushroom	Resources describes in some detail how alternative mushroom production systems have been used successfully in developing countries . In practice it is unlikely that the beginner can successfully compete in the wholesale market against highly capitalized and efficient mushroom companies . A better choice for the beginner is to develop a niche market for fresh mushrooms then sell them at retail or to produce a mushroom product such as a soup mix or sauce 
mushroom	Paul Stamets was an early advocate of integrating a variety of mushrooms into a permaculture system . Stamets 1994 In his design agricultural wastes like cornstalks wheat straw or rice straw can be used as growing media for oyster mushrooms 
mushroom	The King stropharia or wine cap mushroom Stropharia grows best outdoors and plays a key role as a recycler of woody debris . The mushrooms are good to eat when small . Large mature mushrooms attract fly larvae that make excellent fish or poultry food 
mushroom	Stamets grows shiitakes namekos Pholiota nameko and Lion mane Hericium erinaceus mushrooms on inoculated logs set in a fence row while other species like maitake Grifola frondosa reishi Ganoderma lucidum and clustered are cultivated on stumps as part of a hardwood forest management system 
mushroom	A mushroom cultivation kit check with suppliers listed below is a handy way to begin to understand the fungal life cycle . Once you successfully use the kit you can begin to learn the steps that precede that final fruiting stage of the mushroom life cycle 
mushroom	According to these criteria oyster Pleurotus species and shiitake Lentinus edodes mushrooms are probably best for most novices although the maitake Grifola frondosa is also a possibility . The former two are relatively easy to grow and there is already a market for them largely because commercial producers of white button Agaricus bisporus mushrooms have been diversifying into specialty mushrooms . If you intend to grow mushrooms commercially shiitake or oyster mushrooms are your best choices 
mushroom	Oyster mushrooms Pleurotus species are a good choice for beginning mushroom cultivators because they are easier to grow than many of the other species and they can be grown on a small scale with a moderate initial investment . Another advantage of growing oyster mushrooms is that a high percentage of the substrate converts to fruiting bodies increasing the potential profitability 
mushroom	Oyster mushrooms can become an integral part of a sustainable agriculture system . Many types of organic wastes from crop production or the food processing industry can be used to support oyster mushroom production 
mushroom	There are an increasing number of Web sites devoted to oyster mushroom production 
mushroom	Oyster mushroom cultivation has one significant drawback some people are allergic to the spores 
mushroom	However because of the short shelf life of many oyster mushroom varieties this species may offer a special advantage to the local grower who markets directly and can consistently deliver a fresh product 
mushroom	Shiitakes Lentinus edodes are well suited as a alternative enterprise because they like oyster mushrooms can be grown on a small scale with a moderate initial investment . Shiitake mushrooms are grown on logs either inside or outside 
mushroom	The pinheads grow into mushrooms in the next couple of days 
mushroom	Although it is easier to produce shiitakes organically than some of the other mushrooms weed fungi as well as pests such as slugs and flies can reduce fruiting and quality 
mushroom	Today most shiitakes and many other mushroom species are raised on a sterilized sawdust substrate 
mushroom	For example Crop King sells a small mushroom production system including an inoculation table and bagging station for about 
mushroom	Growing mushrooms on sawdust requires attention to detail especially careful monitoring and timely processing of the blocks bottles or bags 
mushroom	Mycorrhizal mushrooms are the hardest to grow commercially because the needs of both the fungus and the host plant must be met in order to produce a commercial crop 
mushroom	The patent and facility are owned by Terry Farms and represent the only successful commercial process for fruiting these highly valued mushrooms out of season 
mushroom	If you are successful these mushrooms will fruit in the spring at the same time as wild morels 
mushroom	Since these mushrooms do completely emerge from the ground they have traditionally been sniffed out by pigs or trained dogs 
mushroom	Finally the forest environment that supports the growth of wild mushrooms is a fragile one 
mushroom	Mushroom the Journal see Resources provides excellent information on wild mushrooms . There are also many local mycological societies that schedule forays trips to known mushroom habitats where the inexperienced forager can learn about various species and how to identify them 
mushroom	Here are some examples of methods used to control typical pests in the production of white button mushrooms . Mushroom flies a common pest among many cultivated mushrooms are attracted to the smell of decaying vegetation such as mushroom substrates 
mushroom	Screening the mushroom house ventilation system will keep adult flies out . Biocontrol is another option for several mushroom pests the sciarid fly among them 
mushroom	Stay alert for any evidence of damage to the fruiting mushrooms and act quickly to identify its cause 
mushroom	If you ca sell your mushrooms at a price that ensures a reasonable profit margin you do want to invest in this enterprise 
mushroom	Another resource as you analyze the potential for a mushroom business is your local Small Business Administration office 
mushroom	Large companies produce virtually all Agaricus mushrooms most are located in Pennsylvania and California . Their production houses are full of mushrooms in every stage of development 
mushroom	Many specialty mushrooms can be cultivated but the market though growing is still limited . If you are thinking about starting a commercial mushroom enterprise begin at the end to whom will you sell them You can not make money in any business if you do have buyers for your product . Learn who buys mushrooms what kinds they want and where they shop . You must thoroughly investigate the demand for each mushroom species or product as well as the available marketing outlets before committing large amounts of capital to the enterprise 
mushroom	If you can sell your mushrooms or mushroom products directly to an end user you will naturally receive a better price than if you sell to a wholesaler . Direct marketing of mushrooms at local farmers markets to restaurants or in supermarkets is possible in many locations 
mushroom	However an Arkansas grower found that local grocery chains were interested in her shiitake mushrooms only if she could assure them of a supply 
mushroom	Selling fresh mushrooms to a wholesaler will mean a lower price than if you market directly . However for growers who choose not to involve themselves in direct sales there are established wholesale markets for mushrooms 
mushroom	commercial production of white button mushrooms and other Agaricus varieties such as portobellas and criminis is not recommended for the beginner except on a small scale for direct marketing 
mushroom	Adding value to fresh mushrooms usually means either developing a processed product such as a sauce or drying surplus mushrooms for sale in the when prices are higher 
mushroom	References offers an example of how a small entrepreneur can create and market a mushroom product . Persimmon Hill developed a recipe for a shiitake mushroom sauce and invested in a commercial kitchen to produce it . The farm buys from local growers who since the mushrooms are not for the fresh market can freeze them until they have enough to make a delivery to the processing kitchen worthwhile 
mushroom	As with many farm enterprises mushroom production is often only marginally profitable when labor and management costs are taken into consideration 
mushroom	If you are considering several mushroom species do a financial analysis of each one separately 
mushroom	If you are adding mushroom production to an integrated farming system financial analysis is more difficult 
mushroom	To sell their mushrooms however they relied on a variety of nontraditional marketing approaches 
mushroom	Two periodicals that include mushroom cultivation information are The Mushroom Growers Newsletter and to a lesser degree Mushroom the Journal . Web sites devoted to mushrooms and their cultivation are increasing every year . A selected list of mushroom Web sites is included below 
mushroom	Commercial cultivation of mushrooms is not for everyone . The mushroom cultivator must be able to carry out operations on time be attentive to details and be vigilant about pest invasions 
mushroom	As part of a system mushrooms can augment productivity at any scale 
mushroom	FNAMA focuses more on finding and identifying wild mushrooms than commercial cultivation 
mushroom	Total mushroom information is the banner claim here . This excellent resource features sections on cultivation pests and disease and medicinal mushrooms as well as the monthly webzine Mushworld

banana	Oranges and bananas are two of several common sources of potassium in our diets 
banana	To explain the concern and the fight to solve it one must first delve into banana history . Although commonplace today bananas only became a staple in North America diet late in the last century . They could do so because of a genetic freak a spontaneous mutation in a kind of banana native to Southeast Asia 
banana	The new mutation also had a characteristic that made transport possible all the bananas on a stalk ripen at once about three weeks after they grown to harvestable size . A ripening banana like some other fruits gives off ethylene gas which triggers ripening in nearby fruit . In older banana varieties a fruit or two ripens quickly after cutting 
banana	It was the banana found in the first supermarkets in Alaska and the one most of us grew up with unless we have reached middle age by the kindest calculation 
banana	The growers only option was to keep moving banana plantations to fresh land . By the 1960s even the United Fruit Company could find new land suitable for banana cultivation

banana	No documentation was presented with this submission which would be the defining instance of bananas in SCA heraldry aside from the bananas protected as modern armory in the flag of Fiji . The College presented evidence that bananas or a similar species such as plantains were known to Western Europeans with a banana having been found in a Tudor English midden 
banana	Some members of the College inquired whether a yellow banana was period speculating that period bananas and plantains were of a different color or colors perhaps green . However if we accept a charge we accept it in any heraldic tincture so if bananas are acceptable they should be registerable in any heraldic tincture including Or . Argent Snail also informs us that in the 14th C manuscript Tacuinum Sanitatis which has been translated and had its photos reproduced as The Four Seasons of the House of Cerruti page 82 of the translation states that The banana has a yellow skin when ripe
banana	They are conjoined at the stalk and otherwise nested closely approximating three bananas fesswise in pale conjoined for their entire length . The bananas lose their identifiability as individual bananas by being conjoined as closely as they are in this bunch 
banana	The analogous group of bananas a stalk of bananas is a large cluster that has the rough shape of a cluster of grapes . We would suspect that the hypothetical armorial grouping of bananas would either be in this large impressive stalk format or would maximize the identifiability of the few individual bananas by having their outlines against the field rather than obscured against each other . We suspect that documentation showing period depictions of bananas would help us see how period people perceived the fruit in a way that was most identifiable and such a depiction might be a good guideline for heraldic use 
banana	Lacking documentation for the design presented here as a bunch of bananas and noting that the particular grouping of the bananas diminishes the identifiability of each individual banana this submission can not be registered

banana	We have seen in both the EU banana and EU beef cases that compliance is not always assured 
banana	As this Committee knows the Banana case for reasons quite apart from bananas has become important for what it says about the WTO system 
banana	In September 1997 a WTO appeals panel reiterated the ruling that the EU banana policy contained more illegalities than virtually any other policy ever reviewed in dispute settlement .

banana	For the last four years I have been working on the problem created when the United States took the case of the European banana regime to the WTO .

banana	The countries of the Caribbean Community are predominantly small island democracies many of which are completely dependent on banana production .

banana	The banana case was the first case that the United States brought before the WTO despite the fact that the United States does not export bananas . Only one company Chiquita Brands claimed to have been harmed by the banana regime 
banana	We have seen in both the EU banana and EU beef cases that compliance is not always assured 
banana	Even now disputes over the EU banana regime hormone ban and an ongoing dispute over veterinary equivalency for poultry have soured relations between the governments 
banana	In two of the first several disputes pursued under the WTO new dispute settlement procedures the European Union import restrictions on bananas and meats from animals treated with hormones were found to be in violation of WTO rules .

banana	There is no agricultural policy anywhere in the globe that has been more heavily litigated in GATT and WTO dispute settlement than the EU banana policy 
banana	To the contrary in the case of bananas it led to a licensing and quota regime considerably more discriminatory and than many of the barriers prohibited by the Uruguay Round 
banana	Even gauged against historical EU restrictions the illegalities of the present banana policy go far beyond traditional EU protection for farmers to include protection as well for EU middlemen throughout the distribution chain .

banana	A substantial majority of EU member states favor banana reform . To USTR great credit all of the many WTO rulings rendered against the banana regime are clear and comprehensive

banana	against EU agriculture practices no trade in beef or bananas has resumed

Preferential treatment was given by the EU to certain Caribbean countries exports of bananas and the method of EU administration of the tariff rate quota TRQ was brought into question

bucket	While the expansion of water as it freezes is the underlying cause of bursting pipes and bent buckets the actual deformation or breakage of the water container results from a secondary consequence of the expansion namely hydraulic pressure in that part of the water last to freeze 
bucket	A metal bucket set on a block of styrofoam ends up with a bulged bottom created by the hydraulic pressure in the last water to freeze in this case at the bottom of the bucket . Yet if the styrofoam is placed on the top of the bucket no bulging occurs because the last water to freeze is near the top surface where there is no metal to be bent 
bucket	Hence if one places a wooden or other insulating bucket filled with hot water out in the cold and places beside it a similar bucket equally filled with cold water the two will evaporate unequally . By the time both come down to the same temperature a temperature still above freezing the bucket originally containing hot water will contain less water than the one originally filled with cold . If the walls of the buckets are vertical both liquids contained therein still have the same surface area exposed to air so the rate of evaporation from this time on is essentially the same in both . Since cooling is presumed to continue to be only by evaporation the bucket with the least water must reach freezing temperature the soonest

bucket	If there is some problem with obtaining or sending the bucket brigades or the buckets in it filters need to return the error returned by the method that tried to manipulate the bucket brigade or the bucket 
bucket	A bucket represents a chunk of data . Each bucket in a brigade can be modified removed and replaced with another bucket . To manipulate a bucket one does need to know its internal representation 
bucket	The stream of data is represented by bucket brigades . by modifying some buckets and passed to the next filter in the stack 
bucket	The figure tries to show that after the presented bucket brigade has passed through several filters some buckets were removed some modified and some added . Of course the handler that gets the brigade can not tell the history of the brigade it can only see the existing buckets in the brigade 
bucket	The first using the connection socket to read and write the data and the second using bucket brigades to accomplish the same and allow for connection filters to do their work 
bucket	Now let look at the same module but this time implemented by manipulating bucket brigades and which runs its output through a connection output filter that turns all uppercase characters into their lowercase equivalents 
bucket	The handler receives the incoming data via bucket bridges one at a time in a loop . It then process each bridge by retrieving the buckets contained in it reading the data in then creating new buckets using the received data and attaching them to the outgoing brigade . When all the buckets from the incoming bucket brigade were transformed and attached to the outgoing bucket brigade a flush bucket is created and added as the last bucket so when the outgoing bucket brigade is passed out to the outgoing connection filters it wo be buffered but sent to the client right away 
bucket	We could simply pass the whole brigade unmodified without even looking at the buckets . To accomplish that modification simply add a code that transforms the data which has been read from the bucket before it inserted to the outgoing brigade 
bucket	These data chunks are stored in buckets which form bucket brigades . Input and output filters massage the data in bucket brigades . Response and protocol handlers also receive and send data using bucket brigades though in most cases this is hidden behind wrappers such as read and print . filters can directly manipulate the bucket brigades or use the simplified streaming interface where the filter object acts similar to a filehandle which can be read from and printed to 
bucket	Even though you do use bucket brigades directly when you use the streaming filter interface which works on bucket brigades behind the scenes it still important to understand bucket brigades . For example you need to know that an output filter will be invoked as many times as the number of bucket brigades sent from an upstream filter or a content handler . Or you need to know that the end of stream indicator EOS is sometimes sent in a separate bucket brigade so it should be a surprise that the filter was invoked even though no real data went through . As we delve into the filter details you will see that understanding bucket brigades will help to understand how filters work 
bucket	Filters get invoked as many times as the number of bucket brigades sent from an upstream filter or a content provider 
bucket	Filters should never make an assumption that the EOS bucket is arriving alone in a bucket brigade . Therefore the first output filter will be invoked two or three times three times if EOS is coming in its own brigade depending on the number of bucket brigades sent by the response handler 
bucket	A user may install an upstream filter and that filter may decide to insert extra bucket brigades or collect all the data in all bucket brigades passing through it and send it all down in one brigade 
bucket	it possible that one brigade will include the beginning of the token will come in the next bucket brigade on the next filter invocation . In certain cases it may involve more than two bucket brigades to get the whole token . Another good example is a filter that performs data compression compression is usually effective only when applied to relatively big chunks of data so if a single bucket brigade does contain enough data the filter may need to buffer the data in the filter context till it collects enough of it 
bucket	So if this test is performed at the beginning of the handler and the EOS bucket was sent in together with the data the EOS event may be missed and filter wo function properly 
bucket	Depending on whether this is an input or an output filter the blocking happens when the bucket brigade is requested from the upstream filter or when the bucket brigade is passed to the downstream filter 
bucket	First of all the input and output filters differ in the ways they acquire the bucket brigades which includes the data that they filter . Instead of reading the data in and printing it out the bucket brigades are now passed as is 
bucket	Here the first filter acquires the bucket brigades containing the response data from the content handler or another protocol handler if we are talking HTTP it then may apply some modification and pass the data to the next filter using the passbrigade call which in turn applies its modifications and sends the bucket brigade to the next filter etc . Even though the output filters do have to wait to acquire the bucket brigade since the upstream filter passes it to them as an argument they still block in a similar fashion to input filters since they have to wait for the passbrigade call to return 
bucket	modperl provides two interfaces to filtering a direct bucket brigades manipulation interface and a simpler interface 
bucket	If we are in the input mode in the same call we retrieve the bucket brigade from the previous filter on the input filters stack and immediately link it to the bb variable which makes the bucket brigade available to the next input filter when the filter handler returns . Next we call bbdump which dumps the type of the filter and the contents of the bucket brigade to STDERR without influencing the normal data flow 
bucket	If we are in the output mode the bb variable already points to the current bucket brigade 
bucket	We can see that for this request each header is put into a separate brigade with a single bucket 
bucket	So far all the buckets were of the HEAP type meaning that they were allocated from the heap memory . Notice that the HTTP request input filters will never see the bucket brigades with HTTP headers as it has been consumed by the last core connection filter 
bucket	The request filter sees a bucket brigade with a single bucket of type TRANSIENT which is allocated from the stack memory 
bucket	Create a new empty bucket brigade ctxbb pass it to the upstream filter via getbrigade and wait for this call to return . When it returns ctxbb is populated with buckets . Now the filter should move the bucket from ctxbb to bb on the way modifying the buckets if needed . Once the buckets are moved and the filter returns the downstream filter will receive the populated bucket brigade 
bucket	Pass bb to getbrigade to the upstream filter so it will be populated with buckets . Once getbrigade returns the filter can go through the buckets and modify them in place or it can do nothing and just return in which case the downstream filter will receive the bucket brigade unmodified 
bucket	Both techniques allow addition and removal of buckets . Though the second technique is more efficient since it does have the overhead of create the new brigade and moving the bucket from one brigade to another 
bucket	As promised in this filter handler we have used the first technique of bucket brigade modification . The handler creates a temporary bucket brigade ctxbb populates it with data using getbrigade and then moves buckets from it to the bucket brigade bb which is then retrieved by the downstream filter when our handler returns 
bucket	Now you probably ask yourself why did we have to go through the bucket brigades filters when this all can be done so much simpler . In certain cases a bucket brigade filter may be more efficient than the . For example if the filter applies transformation to selected buckets certain buckets may contain open filehandles or pipes rather than real data . And when you call read the buckets will be forced to read that data in . But if you did want to modify these buckets you could pass them as they are and let Apache do faster techniques for sending data from the file handles or pipes 
bucket	It only possible to get more than one bucket brigade from the same filter handler invocation if the filter is not using the streaming interface and by simply calling getbrigade as many times as needed or till EOS is received 
bucket	Moreover a single line may be split between across two or even more bucket brigades so we have to store the unprocessed string in the filter context so it can be used on the following invocations 
bucket	The bucket brigades output filter version is just a bit more complicated than the one . The handler receives the incoming bucket brigade bb as its second argument . Since when the handler is completed it must pass a brigade to the next filter in the stack we create a new bucket brigade into which we are going to put the modified buckets and which eventually we pass to the next filter 
bucket	The core of the handler is in removing buckets from the head of the bucket brigade bb while there are some reading the data from the buckets reversing and putting it into a newly created bucket which is inserted to the end of the new bucket brigade . If we see a bucket which designates the end of stream we insert that bucket to the tail of the new bucket brigade and break the loop 
bucket	It quite possible that reading one bucket brigade is not enough 
bucket	When the filter realizes that it does have enough data in the current bucket brigade it can store the read data in the filter context and wait for the next invocation of itself which may or may not satisfy its needs 
bucket	Instead of returning an empty bb the input filter can initiate the retrieval of extra bucket brigades until the underrun condition gets resolved 
bucket	It is clear from the debugging output that the filter was invoked only three times instead of six times there were six bucket brigades . Notice that the upstread input filter if any was aware that there were six bucket brigades since it saw only three . Our example filter did do much with those tokens so it has only repackaged data from 8kb per bucket brigade to 16389 bytes per bucket brigade 
bucket	Once the underrun condition is satisfied we have at least one complete token the tokens are put into a bucket brigade and returned to the upstream filter for processing keeping any remainders in the filter context for the next invocations or flushing all the remaining data if EOS has been seen 
bucket	In this module we use flattenbb to read the data from the buckets and signal when the EOS is received 
bucket	If a filter desires to store the incoming buckets for post processing . It must check whether the bucket type is transient . If not the buckets may contain corrupted data when used later . The right thing is accomplished transparently by aprbucketsetaside for which we need to provide a perl glue 
bucket	But it probably a good idea to ask at least 8k so if a bucket brigade has 8k nothing will need to be stored in the internal buffer 
bucket	a file handle can be put in a bucket and the read from the file can be postponed to the very moment when the data is sent to the client thus saving a lot of memory and CPU cycles . though filters writers should be aware that if they call b read or any other operation that internally forces the bucket to read the information into the memory like the length op and thus making the data handling inefficient 
bucket	Notice that you should either complete the current filter invocation normally by calling getbrigade or passbrigade depending on the filter kind or if nothing was done return Apache2 Const DECLINED and modperl will take care of passing the current bucket brigade through unmodified to the next filter in chain 
bucket	This is a streaming filter method which acquires a single bucket brigade behind the scenes and reads data from all its buckets . Therefore it can only read from one bucket brigade per filter invocation 
bucket	After the EOS bucket is read the filter should expect not to be invoked again 
bucket	When this flag is prematurely set before the real EOS bucket has arrived in the current filter invocation instead of invoking the filter again modperl will create and send the EOS bucket to the next filter ignoring any other bucket brigades that may have left to consume 
bucket	The issue is that buckets from one request may get buffered and not sent during the lifetime of the request so it not easy to give a truly accurate count of bytes sent to the network for this response 
bucket	This function can be useful in situations where you have a single brigade that you wish to reuse many times by destroying all of the buckets in the brigade and putting new buckets into it later 
bucket	Important in order to avoid unnecessary data copying the variable is stored in the bucket object . That means that if you modify data after passing it to new you will modify the data in the bucket as well 
bucket	It important to know that certain bucket types e . file bucket may perform a split and insert extra buckets following the current one 
bucket	When the bucket is removed it not not destroyed . Usually this is done in order to move the bucket to another bucket brigade . Or to copy the data way before destroying the bucket . If the bucket was moved to another bucket brigade it must be destroyed 
bucket	However if your code does know which bucket types it may need to setaside you may want to check the return code and deal with any errors . As of this writing the pipe and socket buckets ca setaside in which case you may want to look at the apsavebrigade implementation 
bucket	Usually setaside is called by certain output filters in order to buffer socket writes of smaller buckets into a single write . This method works on all bucket types not only the modperl bucket type but as explained in the exceptions section not all bucket types implement this method 
bucket	When a modperl bucket is setaside its data is detached from the original perl scalar and copied into a pool bucket 
bucket	gdbinit Now if for example you want to dump the contents of the bucket brigade you can do gdb dumpbrigade mybrigade where mybrigade is the pointer to the bucket brigade that you want to debug

For example if your hashing algorithm used only the first four characters of a key any lookups of keys that started with the same four characters would result in a bucket collision which would degrade performance of the hash table . Each time you performed a lookup on one of these keys GLib would have to sift through the linked list of myth keys in that bucket

bucket	To help you get started building your collection we created an example of a simple Microsoft Access database based on ADL buckets . This example database is a database based on ADL buckets 
bucket	The ADL search bucket framework provides a uniform view of the library and provides the elemental items that are aggregated and collated into statistical summaries and histograms in the CLM for the benefit of clients and the collection discovery service 
bucket	Queries against this bucket are evaluated using a Plate Carre projection i
bucket	The middleware query language is a generic language that supports boolean combinations of typed constraints against abstract metadata fields or search buckets 
bucket	The metadata for a collection contains a number of items of interest to clients the buckets supported by the collection the thesauri used to categorize the collection the number of items in the collection both overall and broken down by type and format the spatiotemporal distribution of the items and so on 
bucket	and then outputs the mapped metadata which currently consists of the ADL bucket view only 
bucket	The mapped ADL bucket view is written to standard output 
bucket	The bucket type determines what constitutes a valid tuple and in particular it determines how many components a tuple may have and the semantics of and any syntactic restrictions on tuple components . Some bucket types such as the textual type place little constraint on tuples but other bucket types such as the spatial and temporal types require specific component syntaxes . Thus in creating a mapping and especially in developing queries and writing filter and converter functions a good understanding of the bucket type in question is paramount . For background information on bucket types consult the ADL middleware specifications 
bucket	The ID must be unique among the IDs of all mappings to bucket 
bucket	The requirement and expectation statements place additional checks on the numbers of mappings made to buckets which can be a useful sanity check when processing large numbers of metadata records 
bucket	The bucket field and id arguments in these statements govern the mapping s to which the statement applies . If only bucket is specified the statement applies to all mappings to that bucket . If field is specified as well the statement applies only to mappings to bucket from field . If id is specified the statement applies only to the identified mapping to bucket 
bucket	The bucketType statement can appear anywhere but by convention bucket types are defined by modules in the buckettypes directory . bucket type to be automatically loaded 
bucket	That is given a set of items having metadata we form the collection by mapping the metadata to the ADL buckets with little to no manipulation the only work required is deciding which metadata fields map to which buckets 
bucket	This is certainly appropriate metadata for a DRG but when the text is mapped in its entirety to the adl bucket the result is that a search for the phrase digital line graphs will return every DRG 
bucket	Mapping this sentence to the adl bucket means that a search for Alaska will return every DRG 
bucket	ADL configuration mechanism not specific to metadata mapping is the overlap and outright duplication between the bucket configuration related to report generation and that related to query translation 
bucket	Because the universal query translator has no intrinsic support for such bucket relationships must be implemented manually . In particular the configurations for the adl titles and adl buckets must be repeated but not exactly duplicated due to slight syntactic differences in the configuration for the adl bucket 
bucket	Supporting hierarchical buckets specifically adl types and adl formats will almost always be complicated by the fact that vocabulary terms used in the native metadata must be mapped to the terms used by the bucket 
bucket	no verification that the terms used in the collection configuration are indeed vocabulary terms and no check that the terms used in bucket reports agree with those used in query translation 
bucket	In addition to the above this bucket implicitly includes the mappings to the adl titles and adl buckets 
bucket	There are multiple thesauri associated with this bucket one for each content standard . process standards and teaching standards could be mapped to this bucket as well but as yet they are unpopulated by DLESE 
bucket	The functional value of this information is that it allows ADL to search across both overall buckets and individual fields . For example referring to the mapping to the adl bucket above it is possible to search over all assigned terms subject terms and keywords or over subject terms only 
bucket	This is most apparent in the adl originators bucket where we listed Author and Publisher as fields even though in ADN these are characterized as roles that contributors can play 
bucket	This will determine what buckets are supported by your collection 
bucket	For example if the bucket99 
bucket	Access to the collectionavailability cachecontrol rmicontrol and bucket99status servlets can be restricted through the servlet container only 
bucket	By contrast collections are generally free to use any metadata the only requirement being that metadata must be mapped to the ADL search buckets and to the standard ADL metadata views 
bucket	Added a new bucket type the relational bucket type that supports description of arbitrary relationships between collection items relationships may cross collection boundaries 
bucket	In the Tomcat configuration file add a middlewareconfigurationfile parameter to the bucket99status servlet configuration but then as noted previously the parameter can now be specified in just one place in the file 
bucket	Other renames bucket99 to bucket99 
bucket	Describes the mappings of the holding metadata to search buckets 
bucket	bucket99 
bucket	The adl geographic locations bucket contains the footprints of library objects . The adl geographic location bucket contains the geographic coordinates latitude and longitude of the vertices of the geographic polygons bounding the object footprint 
bucket	ADL uses the adl geographic locations bucket to support its geographic search capability . Three query operations are defined on the bucket contains the footprint in the bucket wholly contained in a query footprint within the footprint is wholly within the query footprint and overlaps the footprint in the bucket at least partially overlaps a query footprint 
bucket	In practice the footprints assigned to the adl geographic location bucket usually fall into one of two special cases points single vertices and bounding boxes rectangles 
bucket	The adl dates bucket may contain any dates or date ranges beginning and ending date associated with the object such as its date of creation or period of validity 
bucket	The adl dates range bucket may be thought of as the temporal analog of the adl geographic location bucket that is date ranges are time footprints . Searches against the adl dates range bucket may likewise specify overlap or containment although the mechanism is somewhat different 
bucket	The adl types bucket contains terms that precisely specify an object form or content . Valid terms for the type bucket are drawn from an hierarchical vocabulary 
bucket	The adl types and adl format buckets are the only buckets for which we currently mandate specific sets of valid terms . In the particular cases of the adl types and adl format buckets the need for interoperability is strong enough and the scope of the term spaces constrained enough to make controlled vocabularies both useful and feasible . In the specific case of the adl types bucket for example we are growing the type schemes for catalogs and gazetteers by merging existing vocabularies 
bucket	The adl formats bucket contains terms drawn from an vocabulary that indicate the mechanisms by which a copy of the object can be delivered to a library user 
bucket	Where possible the controlled vocabulary for the adl formats bucket exploits standard terminology such as MIME type specifiers for digital data 
bucket	The adl title bucket contains the name by which an individual item in the collection is known 
bucket	The adl originators bucket contains any text describing people or institutions responsible for the object creation or dissemination that is any entity that could be an object source 
bucket	The level of aggregation in the adl originators bucket tends to complicate some kinds of searches since the bucket does include semantics for personal or corporate names nor does it require a particular kind of normalization when names are entered 
bucket	The adl assigned terms bucket is a proper subset of the adl text bucket . Text should only be placed in the adl assigned terms bucket if it was specifically marked as significant by the object original catalogers that is the creators of the object detailed metadata . If the assigned terms are selected from a controlled vocabulary such as a thesaurus or a subject heading list then a link can be made from this bucket to that vocabulary . We encourage this practice but do not assume it in the semantics of the bucket 
bucket	The adl text bucket contains text gleaned or derived from the object detailed that is metadata that indicates any topics or themes associated with the object 
bucket	The adl identifiers bucket may contain any labels for the object that are defined with respect to an externally controlled vocabulary or production rule such as ISBNs technical report numbers satellite image identifiers etc
bucket	In effect the adl identifiers bucket provides a trap door into alternative cataloging schemes . A nomenclature that is elsewhere can be accessed through the adl identifiers bucket and often provides the simplest and most precise means of locating an object assuming one is familiar with the nomenclature 
bucket	We assume that identifiers are normalized upon entry into the buckets such as removing dashes from ISBNs and that the search terms are likewise normalized prior to issuing a query . The adl identifiers bucket has no knowledge of the structure or semantics of specific identifier types 
bucket	ADL has defined a set of nine standard search buckets . When setting up your ADL collection you must provide mappings between the search buckets and your own specific metadata . The ADL search buckets are listed below 
bucket	When setting up your ADL collection you must provide mappings between the search bucket and your own specific metadata see Adding Collections . We kept the buckets few and simple to make it easier to map the search buckets to your metadata 
bucket	The adl text adl assigned terms adl originators and adl identifiers buckets are all searchable with the standard ADL text operators any word true if the target bucket contains any of the query words anywhere and in any order . all words true only if the target bucket contains all of the query words anywhere and in any order . exact phrase true only if the target bucket contains the query phrase as a proper substring 
bucket	ADL queries are translated into SQL queries using the bucket definitions you provide in this file 
bucket	It is not necessary to define all nine of the standard ADL buckets however a query will fail if an ADL query is used that contains a constraint that corresponds to a bucket that is not defined so the collection developer needs to consider what types of queries are supported by the metadata for a collection and what types of queries should be supported for a collection

bucket	For the bucket you would search across the index generated over all the supported columns or a single aggregated column and for fielded searching you search the individual indexes 
bucket	A key component of this architecture is a framework the ADL bucket framework for creating homogeneous views of heterogeneous metadata . The ADL bucket framework supports aggregation of semantically similar strongly typed metadata fields into buckets for the specific purposes of providing search and description functions . Notably in mapping metadata fields to buckets the mappings themselves are formally and explicitly represented by the system and metadata semantics are preserved and carried throughout . The framework defines standard representations and bucket types including sophisticated types such as the geospatial bucket type which supports description of geospatial regions and searching using spatial operations . The framework also defines a particular set of 10 buckets that have proven successful in capturing key searchable and descriptive characteristics of widely heterogeneous items while having sufficient global applicability as to be easily populated . For example the Originator bucket is defined to contain textual values specifically names related to the origin of an item . One item may map the tuple MARC 100 Personal name Mark Twain to the Originator bucket while another may map the tuple FGDC 1 . Geological Survey to the same bucket . In general an item may map any number of typed field value pairs to a bucket . The ultimate effect of such mappings is that clients of the library can choose to 1 operate at the high level of buckets e
bucket	Several other approaches to metadata interoperability have been pursued in the past and it is useful to compare the bucket framework to them 
bucket	The ADL bucket framework combines many aspects of these different approaches in a new and novel way . Like the Semantic Web the bucket framework maintains representations of metadata semantics . But unlike the Semantic Web the bucket framework provides a mechanism for aggregating metadata into uniform abstractions . The bucket framework is notably similar to unqualified Dublin Core in that it provides a standard set of fields . But it differs just as notably to Dublin Core the bucket framework adds fields strong typing and rich search semantics . The bucket framework provides a refinement mechanism similar to qualified Dublin Core but unlike the latter the refined fields are not mandated by the system but rather are simply discoverable in a standard way . Finally the bucket framework is similar to automated metadata translation systems in that metadata is mapped from one form to another but the bucket framework differs from the Stanford Infobus approach in that it is focused on the simpler problem of mapping arbitrary metadata to a common form as opposed to mapping arbitrary forms of metadata to one another 
bucket	The ADL bucket framework is a common thread running throughout the tiers that provides a uniform view of the library . Specifically at the lowest level individual items within collections map their native metadata to buckets . Collections accumulate and index the mapped metadata thereby providing a search capability over their contents at both the bucket level and at the native metadata level 
bucket	The specifies boolean constraints on combinations of the ADL search buckets a standard set of search metadata . Each collection supported by ADL must specify a mapping from its own metadata into the search bucket attributes . there will inevitably be a loss of precision in querying the search buckets versus querying the metadata directly . However by exposing only a single set of searchable metadata the ADL middleware allows clients to be built that can both exploit search bucket semantics e . spatially manipulate the location bucket and can search all of ADL via a single connection 
bucket	In the current implementation a basic architectural assumption is that the underlying servers will expose views that are as closely as the particular server allows exact correlates to the ADL search buckets and retrieval sections 
bucket	Accommodating their quite different schemas has been a good test of our search bucket mapping strategy i . The only features that we currently exploit are the MapInfo spatial data types and their associated operators and indices to implement the location search bucket 
bucket	The report of the evaluation sessions contained comments on the registration process general comments comments on the sections searching comments categorized by unpredictable results searching setting limit on size of result set display of search strategy stopping query processing search buckets multiple windows management using the map browser sorting and understanding result sets use of the Workspace Window metadata display and the exit poll 
bucket	In the requirements list generated through discussion with the executive committee the implementation team and the user interface evaluation team it was determined that the new UI would fulfill the following criteria the system would present a unified search screen to the user integrating the gazetteer the catalog and the searching which had formerly been kept separate helping to reduce and simplify the set of search types for metadata attributes search buckets allowing users to select search areas on map rather than use whole map window as search area allowing querying of spatial areas provision of a summary view of the session to the user within the session 
bucket	The search window contained several panels of GUI widgets which mapped to the ADL defined search buckets 
bucket	The Java client built by IDI would be designed to enable users to stop a query and issue a new one return to a previous point in the session modify and reissue a query view the total number of items in the results set sort result set by search bucket parameters display footprint distribution of result sets set display formats for metadata access low resolution browse images that can be enlarged for evaluation allow selected items to be organized in a set of collections allow queries to be to the system in a later session and allow storage of geographic areas in a personal gazetteer 
bucket	Object level metadata is mapped to ADL in three ways 1 to the middleware search buckets and some additional scan attributes 2 to the access report and 3 to the full metadata report 
bucket	This metadata also tells the middleware which search buckets are active for any particular collection and what the controlled domains are for the associated buckets 
bucket	dtd and the standard ADL search buckets that constraints may be placed against are described under client interfaces 
bucket	The view may be one of the three standard ADL metadata views adl bucket adl browse or adl access or any other view supported by the item 
bucket	This class reads the following properties from the Bucket99 driver configuration file bucket99 
bucket	The query must contain a spatial constraint against bucket adl if not an exception is raised 
bucket	A result spatial footprint is obtained from the result mapping to the adl bucket in its ADL bucket view 
bucket	This paper discusses our development and use of the search bucket concept . We then present the current ADL search buckets in detail including their types operations population rules and pending issues . We describe how the search buckets are implemented in the current ADL architecture specifically how they are supported by ADL server collection and client user interfaces . We compare the ADL search buckets to other metadata designs . Finally we discuss possible future developments of the search bucket concept 
bucket	The geographic location bucket contains the footprints of library objects . The geographic location bucket contains the geographic coordinates latitude and longitude of the vertices of the geographic polygons bounding the object footprint 
bucket	ADL uses the geographic location bucket to support its geographic search capability . Two query operations are defined on the bucket contains the footprint in the bucket is wholly contained in a query footprint and overlaps the footprint in the bucket at least partially overlaps a query footprint 
bucket	In practice the footprints assigned to the geographic location bucket usually fall into one of two special cases points single vertices and bounding boxes rectangles 
bucket	The type bucket contains terms that precisely specify an object form or content . Valid terms for the type bucket are drawn from an hierarchical vocabulary . The single query operation defined on the type bucket is thus an exact match against nodes or leaves in the type hierarchy 
bucket	The type and format buckets are the only buckets for which we currently mandate specific sets of valid terms . In the particular cases of the type and format buckets the need for interoperability is strong enough and the scope of the term spaces constrained enough to make controlled vocabularies both useful and feasible . In the specific case of the type bucket for example we are growing the type schemes for catalogs and gazetteers by merging existing vocabularies 
bucket	The format bucket contains terms drawn from an vocabulary that indicate the mechanisms by which a copy of the object can be delivered to a library user 
bucket	The assigned term bucket is a proper subset of the topical text bucket . Text should only be placed in the assigned term bucket if it was specifically marked as significant by the object original catalogers i . a thesaurus or a subject heading list then a link can be made from this bucket to that vocabulary . We encourage this practice but do not assume it in the semantics of the bucket 
bucket	The assigned term bucket relationship to the topical text bucket is exploited by ADL current implementation for example one ADL collection implementation reduces the assigned term bucket to a boolean flag on the topical text bucket see section 4
bucket	The originator bucket contains any text describing people or institutions responsible for the object creation or dissemination i
bucket	As was noted in section 2 the level of aggregation in the originator bucket tends to complicate some kinds of searches since the bucket does include semantics for personal or corporate names nor does it require a particular kind of normalization when names are entered 
bucket	Searches against the date range bucket may likewise specify overlap or containment although the mechanism is somewhat different 
bucket	The identifier bucket may contain any labels for the object that are defined with respect to an vocabulary or production rule e
bucket	In effect the identifier bucket provides a trap door into alternative cataloging schemes . A nomenclature that is elsewhere can be accessed through the identifier bucket and often provides the simplest and most precise means of locating an object assuming one is familiar with the nomenclature 
bucket	geographic location that uniquely identifies the bucket and its conceptual contents allowable representations and query operators . Uniqueness guarantees that buckets behave identically regardless of the underlying collection 
bucket	Search bucket semantics and in particular query operators are loosely defined in the current implementation . For example the geographic location bucket does not specify whether overlaps and contains operate on spherical or planar regions 
bucket	In addition to allowing collection servers considerable leeway to interpret bucket semantics we currently do not require any more than a best effort from collection servers to support search bucket query operators 
bucket	A collection server support for search buckets is described by metadata passed from the middleware server to JIGI which uses the metadata to customize search bucket query forms and to properly formulate queries 
bucket	The metadata includes a set of XML bucket elements that describe the search bucket s supported by the collection . There is no requirement that collection servers support every bucket but all collection servers are required as a matter of ADL policy not architecture to support the geographic location bucket 
bucket	The element describes which of the collection metadata is mapped to the bucket and how . For example a collection that utilizes the MARC metadata content standard might document with this element that MARC field 100a main entry personal name is mapped to the originator bucket 
bucket	The notes element gives any additional notes on how the collection populates the bucket and supports its semantics 
bucket	The domain element describes the semantic domain associated with the bucket . Currently this element is used only for the type and format buckets each of which requires that the collection provide a hierarchical thesaurus of terms for use with the bucket query operators 
bucket	We plan to add information about bucket query operators and how the collection supports them 
bucket	The use of attributes makes JIGI more modular and independent of specific search buckets as long as is restricted to the domain of interface types known to JIGI 
bucket	The translation tends to be quite different for each collection server and for each bucket even among otherwise similar servers because of differences in collection server schemata indexing options and the use of platform and constructs 
bucket	ADL search buckets are similar to several other schemes to support information discovery via core metadata . In this section we will briefly compare our search bucket approach to library online catalogs and to the Dublin Core 
bucket	Search bucket semantics specify more precisely the data type of each bucket because this is needed for search operations . In contrast ADL has a Geographic Location bucket specified to contain bounding coordinate values an Assigned Term bucket which can contain place names and a Date bucket with beginning and ending dates specified in a particular format 
bucket	The DC element Language could be a search parameter but is not currently included in the ADL search buckets 
bucket	It is true however that the DC effort and the ADL search buckets are similar in that they have both identified a core set of descriptive elements or searchable parameters as generic approaches to information discovery . Some of the DC elements and the ADL search buckets are direct matches Type Format and Identifier with the difference that for search purposes the bucket semantics are more specific 
bucket	Adding a new bucket should be straightforward as long as it uses an existing operator set see section 4 . since the current ADL architecture essentially tailors itself to whatever search buckets are announced by a particular collection . With only eight buckets defined so far one could even argue that the current scheme is ripe for at least a few additional buckets without incurring undesirable complexity 
bucket	technical details bucket that would hold quantitative information e . Implementing such a bucket would require specifying 1 the types of quantitative data available to be searched 2 the units of measure e
bucket	Subdividing buckets is arguably less desirable since it introduces a fundamental complication into a scheme whose chief attraction is its simplicity . There is also no direct support elsewhere in the ADL architecture for split buckets . However there are some clear current situations where slight additional precision in a bucket query would pay large dividends in usability . The most obvious example is the topical text bucket into which title and abstract text will be lumped if present . Although less significant for digital than for hardcopy information a work title is nonetheless one of the most familiar search criteria and one that could be readily supported by a subdivision of the topical text bucket

If n is much less than N then at each round many of the buckets are empty and it is a waste to visit all the empty ones 
bucket	In this paper we present a new join algorithm called em bucket skip merge join which does not always access all the data items of the join sets . The basic idea is to divide the datasets into buckets that contain monotonically increasing values and maintain high and low values for each bucket . During join processing the algorithm uses these values to skip a whole bucket or parts of a bucket when it can be determined that a match will not be found for the rest of the data items in the bucket

bucket	If a truck node 2 and the crane node 3 are both available then the crane can load and hoist a bucket of concrete node 4 . On the completion of the load and hoist operations the bucket node 5 is available for concrete placement . Placement is accomplished by having a worker guide the bucket elephant trunk between the concrete forms and having a second worker operate the bucket release lever . A third laborer operates a vibrator in the concrete while the bucket node 8 moves back to receive a new load . Once the concrete placement is complete the crew becomes available to place a new bucket load node 7 . After two buckets are placed then the column is complete node 9 and the equipment and crew can move to the next column node 10

bucket	On December 6 1935 Washington Governor Clarence Martin pulled the handle on a four bucket of concrete releasing it into the waiting form marking the first official concrete placement in the dam 
bucket	Soon after it was discovered that rocks and gravel washed into the spillway bucket were eroding the concrete at an alarming rate . To solve the problem Reclamation engineers designed an enormous floating caisson that could be moved from place to place in the spillway bucket and pumped clear of water to provide access for repairs . The base of the caisson was shaped to match the contors of the bucket so a tight seal could be achieved 
bucket	As a general rule tipping bucket gages are used in high precipitation zones and Belfort storage gages are used in areas where snowfall accounts for a significant portion of the total annual precipitation 
bucket	Tipping bucket precipitation gages do not store precipitation . Because tipping bucket gages do not require maintenance visits to empty them they are utilized in areas of high precipitation 
bucket	Advantages Since tipping bucket gages do not store the accumulated precipitation they never require a maintenance visit to empty them therefore maintenance costs are lower 
bucket	Disadvantages Tipping bucket gages are very inefficient when it comes to solid precipitation . Heated tipping buckets improve the catch of frozen precipitation but these gages require AC power which is only available at a limited number of AgriMet stations . During extremely high precipitation intensity a tipping bucket gage may undercatch the actual precipitation due to the time it takes for the two cups to change position 
bucket	Belfort storage gages consist of a bucket to store the precipitation a weighing device to weigh the bucket and the stored precipitation and an outer shell to cover the bucket and weighing device 
bucket	And finally maintenance costs are considerably higher than with tipping bucket gages since the Belfort storage gages must be emptied when they approach their capacity 
bucket	The concrete was loaded into buckets which were transported to the site initially by truck . Eventually the concrete buckets were transported by electric trains 
bucket	bottom dump buckets . These buckets were lifted from the cars and lowered into place by overhead cable ways 
bucket	If too much time was taken the concrete would take its initial set still in the dump buckets and would have to be chipped out by hand . For this reason the men who operated the cranes which moved the buckets into place were some of the highest paid workmen on the project earning 1 . As each bucket was dumped seven puddlers used shovels and feet to distribute the concrete throughout the form and pneumatic vibrators to ensure there were no voids 
bucket	Concrete was delivered to the blocks in buckets eight cubic yards at a time . After each bucket was delivered five or six men would tromp around on the inside of the block packing down the concrete and making sure there were no air holes

bucket	Recently the trend for terminal structures has turned to the flip bucket the principle being to direct the flow away from the structure and downstream a sufficient distance where the water can erode its own plunge pool or flow into a plunge pool . Following are some examples of flip buckets fig . Yellowtail Dam has a combined hydraulic bucket that is it acts as a hydraulic jump energy dissipater up to a predetermined discharge where the jump flips out and the structure acts as a flip bucket for higher discharges . Glen Canyon Dam Arizona has a tunnel spillway through both abutments of the dam both terminating in a flip bucket . A flip bucket directs the jet away from the dam where it impinges nearly vertically into a pool . Trinity Dam tunnel spillway terminates in a flip bucket specifically shaped to direct the jet to the right in a dispersed jet

bucket	The holding tank fish will be collected and sampled after they are held in the tanks for a specified operational duration and then conveyed via a lift bucket or Pescalator screw lift from their respective tanks into a cylindrical plastic tank in lieu of a fish transport truck with an internal net to reduce the amount of swimming space making the fish readily assessable 
bucket	The current Bates Tables were not designed to consider the possibility that the most critical period in the salvage operation from a fish health standpoint may not be the 80 minute holding period within the fish hauling truck but may instead be the transfer period from holding tank to hauling truck while the fish are in the loading bucket . The fish loading bucket Figures 6A 6B is a 1
bucket	At times the debris is so dense that it fouls the transport bucket that transfers the fish from the circular holding tank to the hauling truck as well as the tank inlet to the fish hauling truck . The automated debris screen would be designed to be installed and removed quickly and placed out of the way of the salvage bucket during fish removal and transport to the fish hauling truck 
bucket	Fish will be put into 5 gallon buckets and lowered to water level for release 
bucket	predators are often observed in the holding tank count and haul buckets and within the TFCF haul trucks 
bucket	All measurements will be taken at the UC Davis FCCL before the delta smelt are transported to the TFCF in black buckets with lids 
bucket	 mm TL will be inserted with a method in which the five gallon black buckets will be lowered with a rope and poured into the holding tanks . Our net and frame will be inserted into the drainage pit using the same hoist intended for the and buckets 
bucket	The primary objective of this study is to determine if lifting the holding tank screen prior to collecting fish in the count and buckets is an effective debris removal technique . The method needs to demonstrate that it does not kill a large percentage of fish and it removes an adequate amount of debris from the tank to prevent clogging in the bucket 
bucket	This debris can be a major problem because it can impact fish survival clog the count or bucket and complicate the count and procedures 
bucket	To help evaluate if a significant amount of debris is removed from the holding tank we will determine how much debris by volume it takes in order to clog the count station count bucket bucket and fish and compare this value to how much debris can be removed with the Lift Method 
bucket	Hypothesis 1 Lifting the holding tank screen prior to the count and process removes enough debris to prevent the buckets from clogging with minimal fish loss and reduces the amount of time to complete the process 
bucket	In order to determine how much debris it takes to clog the count and bucket we will simply add known amounts of debris Egeria densa to the buckets fill the buckets with water dump the contents of the buckets into a 4 wide x 4 wide x 4 deep net without rinsing or pushing debris through and observe whether or not the buckets clogs debris does not fall freely from bucket . For example a 100 percent full bucket of debris 450gal will be our starting point for the bucket and if it clogs then 25 percent will be tried . In this manner the quantity that actually clogs the bucket within 10 percent will be identified . This data will give us an idea as to how much debris must be removed by lifting the holding tank screen in order to not clog each bucket 
bucket	Four amounts of debris will be tested based on the bucket clogging density tests previously described . 1 m and the count bucket will be inserted into the drain . Once the debris has fallen into the bucket it will be lifted out of the drain and its contents will be dumped into the count station for processing weighing and counting . The bucket will be lowered again into the holding tank drain and the remaining fish and debris in the holding tanks will be washed into the bucket . The second bucket post sample will be lifted and processed in the same manner as the first bucket 
bucket	We will inject four known quantities of debris into a holding tank based on the clogging tests for the bucket . Once the debris has been injected into a full holding tank it will be drained and the bucket will be inserted into the drain . The bucket will be lifted out of the drain and the contents will be dumped into a 4 wide x 4 wide x 4 eep net mesh and debris weighed . The bucket will be lowered again into the holding tank drain and the remaining debris in the holding tanks will be washed into the bucket . The second bucket will be lifted and processed in the same manner as the first bucket 
bucket	This will be completed when the amount of debris coming into the holding tank either clogs the count station the bucket 
bucket	Four repetitions will be made in determining how much debris it takes to clog the count bucket bucket and truck 
bucket	Three repetitions for each of the four weights of debris will also be made for the determination of the amount of debris removed from the holding tanks by lifting the holding tank screen using both the count and buckets 
bucket	A will be used to determine if the amount of debris remaining in the post bucket is significantly less than that necessary to clog the count buckets or count station . In addition the amount of the debris in the total sample will be tested to see if it is significantly larger than the amount of debris needed to clog the count buckets or count station 
bucket	The percentage of fish lost will be compared to the potential fish lost if the buckets or trucks had clogged completely 
bucket	Black buckets will be used to release the test fish

bucket	Policing at boundaries enforces rate compliance and may be implemented by a simple token bucket 
bucket	Ingress border routers only need to perform a simple policing function that can be implemented with a token bucket 
bucket	In practice the token bucket should be implemented in bytes and a token is considered to be present if the number of bytes in the bucket is equal or larger to the size of the packet . For Premium the bucket can only be allowed to fill to the maximum packet size while Assured may fill to the configured burst parameter . For Assured traffic we just test if the bytes in the bucket are sufficient for the packet size and set A if so 
bucket	The simplest border router input interface is a Profile Meter constructed from a token bucket configured with the contracted rate across that ingress link see figure 5 
bucket	The primitives are general classifier classifier bit setter priority queues policing token bucket and shaping token bucket . These primitives can compose a Marker either a policing or a shaping token bucket plus a bit setter and a Profile Meter a policing token bucket plus a dropper or bit setter 
bucket	Shaping token bucket This is the token bucket required at the leaf router for Premium traffic and shown in figure 3 . An arriving packet is immediately forwarded if there is a token present in the bucket otherwise the packet is enqueued until the bucket contains tokens sufficient to send it 
bucket	Policing token buckets never hold arriving packets but check on arrival to see if a token is available for the packet service class 
bucket	The leaf router mechanism is that shown in figure 3 with the token bucket set to the parameters from the usage profile 
bucket	For example 100kbps of Marked traffic can be sent from LBL to ESNet a Profile Meter at the ESNet egress boundary would have a token bucket set to rate 100kbps 
bucket	by lifting the constraint on the token bucket size or configuring the Premium service rate with the peak traffic rate parameter in the specification and by changing the policing action on packets from dropping to sending the packets to the queue

mailbox	If you want to use a lot of plus addresses choose a system that will automatically deliver a message to the subaddress mailbox if the subaddress mailbox already exists .

mailbox	I decided that the best strategy for me is to not filter spam but instead to filter and let the dregs which are often spam fall through my filters and land in catchall mailboxes . Since the non spam messages if there are any bubble to the top of the box I need to look carefully at only the top of these catchall mailboxes 
mailbox	A magnet is a filtering recipe aka rule that deflects a message into a particular mailbox 
mailbox	It can also be used to and messages that are already in a mailbox 
mailbox	With procmail you can organize your environment variables recipes mailboxes and directories however you like 
mailbox	It is best to not use any of these for a mailbox name unless of course you want a mailbox to be interpreted in the special way 
mailbox	To ensure that you have complete control over your mailboxes do not use any of the special mailbox names on your system . For example I use a mailbox named MaybeSpam for my messages and I do not need to worry about my system these messages because MaybeSpam is not a special mailbox on my system 
mailbox	Avoiding these characters in mailbox names makes it possible for you to have a consistent naming style across different IMAP systems and should make your life easier if your system IMAP server changes or if you move your mailboxes to a system using a different flavor of IMAP 
mailbox	allows a mailbox and a directory hierarchy to have the same name I recommend that you not use the same name for both a mailbox and a directory . This will make your life much easier if you move your mailbox hierarchy to a system that does not support names . For example if you use a Courier Cyrus or Dovecot IMAP server it is possible to create a container named Archive that contains both archived mailboxes and archived messages . My advice is to use this Archive container as either a container of only mailboxes a directory or as a container of only messages a mailbox

mailbox	The instructions below guide you through setting up Procmail to deliver to mailboxes that are in traditional Unix mail spool format mbox . To deliver to a mailbox that is in maildir format you need to append a forward slash to the mailbox name . The table below gives examples of the various types of mailbox specifications that can be used in the action line of a Procmail recipe 
mailbox	In order for Procmail to successfully deliver to a mailbox the mailbox must be in the appropriate format . For example a maildir or MH mailbox must be a directory and a Unix mbox mailbox must be a file 
mailbox	If you want your system mailboxes ORGMAIL and DEFAULT to be in maildir format it is best to specify this in the procmail source code and recompile procmail 
mailbox	If you are delivering messages to mailboxes that will be served to mail clients by Courier IMAP which supports only maildir format mailboxes put a dot . in front of the mailbox name in your Procmail recipe . This leading dot is a hierarchy separator and will ensure that IMAP clients can see these mailboxes . IMAP clients will display the mailbox name without the leading dot or the trailing slash which is just used to tell procmail the format of the mailbox and is not part of the name that used on the Unix system 
mailbox	Procmail will create a log file or mailbox using a umask of 077 unless you or your system administrator changed the Procmail default umask for example by setting the UMASK variable in a procmailrc file 
mailbox	Important maildir Note 1 Do not specify the cur new or tmp subdirectories because these are dealt with automatically by Procmail as long as there is a slash after the mailbox name in the Procmail recipe 
mailbox	The one with procmail testing in the Subject should be in the mailbox and the one without test in the Subject should be in your default inbox 
mailbox	The first recipe puts messages that are sent to the procmail mailing list into a mailbox named and the second recipe puts messages that are sent to the vim mailing list into a mailbox named 
mailbox	You might also want to make a symbolic link to other files and directories such as the directory where your mailboxes are stored 
mailbox	Because of potential locking problems a mailbox that Procmail delivers to should be an actual file and the ORGMAIL mailbox which is discussed in the Troubleshooting section below must not be a symbolic link or a file with more than one hard link 
mailbox	If a client does not use a lock file you should not use that client to change the mailbox while it is receiving messages . I describe how to set up Pine mailbox collections in Setting Up Local and Remote Folder Collections in my Power Pine 
mailbox	If you want to use more than one client to access your mailboxes or make it easy to do that in the future you can use the Unix ln command to link the directory where your mailboxes are stored to the names of the mailbox directories used by other clients 
mailbox	Here are instructions for merging the mailboxes in your existing mailbox directories into a new directory named Msgs and then linking this directory to the names mail Mail and News . In Steps below replace mail with the name of one of your existing mailbox directories 
mailbox	Repeat Steps replacing mail with the name of your other existing mailbox directories . Now symbolically link the Msgs directory to mail Mail and News which are the most commonly used mailbox directory names by doing the following 
mailbox	Of course you can also link the Msgs directory to any other name that a program uses for its mailbox directory . Now all your mailboxes are in one place and you can easily save to and access them from different news and mail clients 
mailbox	Because of dictionary spam and blowback aka backscatter or outscatter from spam that was sent with your domain name in a forged From header I recommend that you set up your domain email so that it does not use a mailbox 
mailbox	If you interact with the server by sending for example an unsubscribe or help request the message will not be put in the mailbox because it will be sent directly to your address rather than the list address 
mailbox	In other words all messages are delivered to a mailbox named if it already exists regardless of how the string was capitalized in the original message or in the envelope recipient address that Tuffmail received 
mailbox	Mail Gmail approach to email some people are starting to keep all their messages in one giant universal mailbox and then using a combination of keywords aka labels or flags or tags and saved searches to zoom in on various groups of messages aka create virtual mailboxes 
mailbox	I especially interested in the best way to do this for various mailbox formats and various IMAP servers

microwave	Although from an operational standpoint this conservative approach was less than successful we can not discount the impact this design and the operational flight tests made on the state of the art of airborne microwave ovens 
microwave	The airline microwave oven is a double magnetron unit weighing 110 lb operating at 2450 Mc and providing approximately 2400 W of power in the enlarged oven cavity . Advancement in the general state of the art of all types of microwave ovens and the old cliche that necessity is the mother of invention explain the drastic changes that took place in the evolution of the sensing devices 
microwave	A lossy glass or ceramic shelf now serves as a medium which can absorb the microwave energy thus negating the requirement for a sensor 
microwave	The feeding objectives were achieved and several airlines are currently designing feeding systems which include a Litton microwave oven as an integral part 
microwave	The state of the art of airborne microwave ovens has improved significantly during the last 6 years 
microwave	Although cooking by microwave in aircraft is a relatively new development it has made significant advances in the last few years 
microwave	There is however a microwave oven being mass produced by our Amana division 
microwave	Most microwave ovens are designed to be universal in use so that any process from heating a cup of soup to completely cooking a large toast is possible 
microwave	It may be possible to save considerable weight in the cavity by painting plating or laminating a microwave conductive coating over a plastic form to replace the usual heavy cavity 
microwave	From a microwave engineer point of view the food should always have the same dielectric parameters be of uniform density and completely load the cavity electrically . As previously mentioned microwave engineers and food technologists should jointly discuss these problems 
microwave	Specially packaged and controlled meals could be passed into the facility to be prepared in a microwave oven 
microwave	The menu contained primarily precooked frozen entrees which were reconstituted in a microwave oven in the MQF 
microwave	Skylab the largest manned space station ever placed in low Earth orbit was launched in 1973 and carried into space the Earth Resources Experiment Package EREP which was designed to view the Earth with sensors that recorded data in the visible infrared and microwave spectral regions . Thus EREP became another step in space exploration by testing the use of camera systems with film return capability narrow frequency bandwidth scanner systems in the visible through spectral regions and the initial use of active and passive microwave systems in Earth resource surveys 
microwave	It consisted of two photographic and four electronic sensor systems table that simultaneously permitted remote sensing of the Earth surface in the visible infrared and microwave regions of the spectrum fig 
microwave	The microwave sensors S193 and S194 recorded data on magnetic tape for processing and analyzing with computers 
microwave	The vast quantity of EREP photographic scanner spectrometric and microwave data returned from the 171 days of manned Skylab operations attest to the operational success of the sensor systems . The complex S193 microwave system operated satisfactorily during the Skylab 2 mission however the scan motion compensator malfunctioned during the Skylab 3 mission . The S194 microwave radiometer operated without malfunctions for the three manned missions . In summary EREP data collection provided for each Principal investigator Pi a comprehensive set of photographs and magnetic tapes containing data in the visible through microwave spectral regions over a wide variety of scenes features and phenomena of the Earth surface 
microwave	For water at microwave frequencies the dielectric constant is quite large as much as 80 whereas that of dry soil is typically less than 5 and that of snow is less than 2 
microwave	Analysis of the response of the microwave instruments Eagleman et al
microwave	Although optical or multispectral scanners can not gather quantitative soil moisture information on a practical basis they can be used very effectively with microwave data to increase the accuracy of soil moisture measurements by providing information about vegetation type and density 
microwave	When the microwave antenna temperatures were analyzed for surface emission which is a function of the percent of soil moisture by weight it was concluded Eagleman et al
microwave	Analysis of the microwave temperatures from S193 and S194 instruments recorded over terrain in the Great Plains has shown that the relationship between brightness temperatures and the water content of the surface of the snow did not resemble that observed in soils . The results of this study based on limited microwave data indicate that it is possible to measure moisture content with a high degree of precision over relatively large areas having low quantities of moisture 
microwave	The photographic system the S192 and the microwave systems were used to map various soil parameters 
microwave	The main reason for studying the relatively low microwave frequencies such as those used with the Skylab Radiometer S194 is that clouds and rain should have a minor effect on the measurement hence in theory temperature should be measurable through clouds if an appropriately chosen frequency is used 
microwave	Hollinger and Lerner developed techniques to calculate the microwave temperature when the salinity windspeed and temperature are known 
microwave	The dependence on salinity was quite weak and the scatter in the microwave temperatures after removal of windspeed and temperature effects was 2 to 3 K about the theoretical curve 
microwave	Because oceanographers require salinity measurements to two significant figures past the integer values in parts per thousand passive microwave systems are not appropriate remote sensors for salinity measurements in the open ocean 
microwave	S194 measurements was the dependence of the passive microwave temperature on windspeed . The passive microwave temperature increased from approximately 96 K to approximately 103 K as the windspeeds varied from 2 . A regression line yielded an equation indicating that the passive microwave temperature increased at a rate of 0 . The difference between the windspeed predicted from the passive microwave temperature and the observed windspeed after removing all these other effects by means of theoretical considerations was approximately 4 
microwave	The experiment was successful in verifying the theory of the microwave emission of the sea surface at a frequency of 1 . In fact two scanning passive microwave systems are being built for use on the and Nimbus satellites theoretically these instruments will be capable of determining temperature surface windspeed and other parameters through clouds 
microwave	The aircraft program yielded data from active and passive microwave systems that were analyzed to infer the age of the ice 
microwave	Data from the airborne passive microwave imaging scanner are shown in both horizontal and vertical polarization in figure a . The microwave temperature fig . The brightness temperature a term equivalent to the passive microwave temperature is different for the two polarizations and for different
microwave	A major conclusion of Campbell study was that the best floating ice remote sensing data can be obtained via the combined operation of passive and active microwave systems . This goal is being fulfilled at least in part by existing and planned active and passive microwave instruments on satellites 
microwave	Passive microwave imaging systems on Nimbus satellites routinely image ice in the Arctic and Antarctic at a fairly coarse resolution 
microwave	The influences of soil type surface roughness and vegetative cover on microwave emission are all wavelength dependent with the strongest effects at the shorter wavelengths ref 
microwave	From the studies it is concluded that the of the microwave is well suited for remote sensing of synoptic soil moisture over large areas under a wide variety of weather vegetation and terrain conditions 
microwave	experiment was to obtain simultaneous measurements of radar backscatter and passive microwave temperatures to demonstrate that the passive microwave temperatures could be used to correct for atmospheric attenuation and that the backscatter measurements after correction could be used to determine windspeed and wind direction 
microwave	The final result of these analyses was provided in an appendix to reference in which the measured backscatter values the passive microwave temperatures the windspeed and wind direction the latitude and longitude of the cell and the time of the observation are tabulated 
microwave	Figure shows the marked increases in passive microwave temperature on one of the lines of cells of constant incidence angle over tropical storm Christine 
microwave	Without doubt the most significant development in satellite meteorology resulting from Skylab was the use of the microwave spectrum to measure the surface wind over the ocean 
microwave	Several EREP investigations were conducted to ascertain the usefulness of microwave radiometers for soil moisture determination . Although the state of the art in longer wavelength microwave radiometry permitted only measurements with an instantaneous field of view of 100 km and more in diameter it was learned that the is well suited for monitoring surface soil moisture under a wide variety of weather vegetation and terrain conditions 
microwave	Measurements by means of either infrared or passive microwave instruments have to be corrected for the effects of the atmosphere 
microwave	Passive microwave sensors will be included on Nimbus and dual infrared bands on Tiros 
microwave	The EREP investigators analyzed data from the photographic mechanical and microwave sensors in ways that were appropriate to a particular application 
microwave	Active and passive microwave sensors operating at the longest wavelengths used by EREP sensors provided CCT data from which information about the atmosphere the surface roughness the soil moisture and the shape of the Earth could be determined . Rigorous methods for computing ocean emission at microwave frequencies for different physical conditions were developed and used to separate various physical parameters from the radiometer data characteristics 
microwave	 cm wavelength in three different modes as a passive radiometer measuring the microwave energy emitted by the Earth as an active scatterometer which sent microwave pulses to the Earth and measured the intensity of the return echo and as a radar altimeter 
microwave	The performance factors of most interest for this passive microwave sensor were its antenna pattern pointing accuracy and radiometric accuracy 
microwave	Several new techniques and special analysis procedures were developed to convert the raw microwave measurements to meaningful data for interpretation and comparison with other independent information 
microwave	One was a general investigation in which brightness temperature and backscatter were categorized for the different incidence angles and polarizations to provide surface signature data for future microwave sensor design . In the second approach the microwave signature was correlated with specific parameters such as ocean windspeed soil moisture and vegetation cover . Using the second method investigators confronted a basic problem of determining the validity and accuracy of the parameters and several techniques were used to separate the uncertainty of the parameter from the inferred parameter as measured by the microwave sensor from space sec 
microwave	The S194 radiometer data obtained over the oceans were used primarily to verify the theoretical relations of the microwave brightness temperature to ocean surface variables such as windspeed temperature and salinity . The different techniques and analyses used to establish the relations between the measured microwave signature and the corresponding physical parameters of the Earth surface are discussed in the following subsections 
microwave	To establish a more precise correspondence between the physical state of the terrain and the microwave data some uniform land areas over which large deviations in the microwave data were observed were studied in detail . Using the antecedent precipitation index API as an estimate of the soil moisture distribution along the satellite groundtrack a correlation between the microwave data and the soil moisture was computed 
microwave	The large uniform forest and areas in Brazil provided an opportunity to investigate the effect of different biomes on microwave radiation and scatter . These detailed investigations have demonstrated that soil moisture is the most significant influence in terrain microwave emission and backscatter and that soil moisture may mask the roughness features of the observed terrain 
microwave	The performance of microwave sensors of soil moisture as a function of incidence angle was investigated by Stucky ref 
microwave	The major objectives achieved by the EREP microwave investigators can be summarized in three areas sensor performance evaluation building of a data base for microwave sensor system design and establishment of potential application areas 
microwave	The results of the microwave investigations have both short and implications 
microwave	Finally the availability of higher spatial resolution performance of higher spatial resolution performance of passive microwave sensors at the longer wavelengths will enable significant global synoptic measurements of soil moisture content 
microwave	A microwave system that was a combination radar scatterometer and passive microwave radiometer operating at approximately 10 GHz 3 cm was proposed 
microwave	Because the longer wavelengths require larger antennas for a given angular resolution higher resolution microwave space sensors usually operate at the shorter wavelengths with the exception of special applications 
microwave	An active microwave sensor transmits repetitive pulsed bursts of energy that are directed in a given direction by the antenna beam 
microwave	The measurements made by passive microwave receivers are converted to passive microwave temperatures which are interpreted in terms of the temperature of the target and its emissivity 
microwave	Features of microwave radiometry were incorporated in the radar scatterometer design to improve the accuracy of the backscatter measurements 
microwave	Radiometer was to evaluate the applicability of a passive microwave radiometer to the study of the Earth from orbital altitudes 
microwave	Radiometer response is shown in terms of microwave brightness temperature . Land surfaces have emissivities approaching that of a black body so that the microwave temperatures for land surfaces are close to actual temperatures 
microwave	The correlations indicate that microwave sensors may be quite useful for such measurements in the future 
microwave	The analysis of microwave data requires highly specialized techniques therefore detailed discussion of procedures and methods for analyzing such data is contained in section 6 
microwave	It has long been argued that signals of extraterrestrial origin will be most apt to be detected in the microwave window wavelengths from about 0
microwave	Terrestrial UHF and microwave emanations now fill a sphere some twenty light years in radius 
microwave	We propose a search for signals in the microwave part of the radio spectrum but not at this time the sending of signals 
microwave	The hardware needed for SETI therefore consists of an antenna or antenna system receivers to cover the end of the microwave window means of resolving the received spectrum to a very high degree and means to search out and identify automatically any spectral anomalies 
microwave	Although it is assumed that the searches performed in this program will be mainly for narrow band signals at the low end of the microwave window other possibilities should not be ignored 
microwave	The system considered would be capable of operating over the I to 10 GHz region of the microwave window 
microwave	At the time the hydrogen line was believed to be unique but since then dozens of other microwave emission lines from a wide variety of interstellar molecules have been discovered 
microwave	The sum of these noise contributions defines a broad quiet region extending from about 1 to 60 GHz known as the microwave window 
microwave	The point is that even if we could the linear amplifier which would then be no noisier than the photon detector would still be far noisier than a linear amplifier operating in the microwave window 
microwave	In the past several decades we have developed a trenchant technology appropriate to searching in the spectral range of the microwave window . No comparable technology has yet been generated for shorter wavelengths so the remarks below are directed in the main toward strategies suited to an initial search in the microwave window and give special attention to the water hole see Section . However our suggested strategies do encompass the spectrum above the microwave region for relevant physical knowledge and suitable technologies are burgeoning e
microwave	Any concern on their part for range would surely highlight the advantages of the low end of the microwave window 
microwave	Again if we can search a 300 MHz frequency band at one time it would take only a few years to search the whole sky over the entire microwave window 
microwave	The total energy of a photon in the microwave region of the electromagnetic spectrum is one ten billionth the kinetic energy of an electron traveling at half the speed of light 
microwave	It is fortunate that for the 100m and up antenna diameter systems falls outside the long wave boundary of the microwave window where ultra low noise feed systems are no longer so critically important 
microwave	This scheme has the advantage that only two masers one for each polarization each with seven to ten all in the same cryogenic package can cover the entire terrestrial microwave window 
microwave	Evidently if the entire microwave window is to be searched the sensitivity should be reduced as the operating frequency increases 
microwave	Depending on frequency such antennas can perform surveys over plausible microwave regions with several orders of magnitude better sensitivity than has been generally achieved 
microwave	To make a microwave search tractable it will be necessary to utilize fully the entire receiver bandwidth while retaining high spectral resolution a processor of 106 channels 
microwave	Hence the polarization structure of microwave spectra is completely unknown 
microwave	The study was concerned with evaluating the comparative cost effectiveness of several different microwave receiving systems that might be used to search for signals from extraterrestrial intelligence 
microwave	In the past observations at visible infrared and microwave wavelengths led most observers to conclude that the Mercurian atmosphere was at best tenuous with a total pressure 0

microwave	Scientific questions about the atmosphere clouds and temperatures of Venus were logically chosen for emphasis on the first Mariner mission The instruments devised to address the questions were microwave and infrared radiometers one to scan the surface at two radiation wavelengths and one to scan the clouds and give us a better idea of the temperatures 
microwave	In addition the telemetry data indicated that only one of the two microwave radiometer channels would have the desired sensitivity . It turned out however that both the microwave radiometer and the infrared radiometer channels had acceptable sensitivities at encounter and that one scan rate change occurred allowing three successful scans of the planet 
microwave	Maser is an acronym for microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation . It operates with a source of microwave energy to augment the strength of the incoming signal without generating much internal noise 
microwave	Applications of the altimeter data to estimate relief Fresnel reflectivity and surface slope and the radiometer data to derive microwave emissivity are summarized and illustrated in conjunction with corresponding SAR image data

microwave	Attached to the launch vehicle was a sensor module which carried the payload of five microwave instruments and their antennas . The major difference between and previous Earth observation satellites was the use of active and passive microwave sensors to achieve an capability

They are then heated to 100 deg C the temperature that these plastic wraps would be subjected to in a microwave oven and sparged into the injection port of the GC 
microwave	A temperature of 100 degrees C was selected since this is the boiling point of water and is the temperature that the plastic wraps would be exposed to under microwave oven conditions 
microwave	The problems have recently become exacerbated by the increased use of packaging films as food wraps during microwave cooking . The high temperatures at or near the boiling point of water encountered in microwave food preparation serve to volatilize the organics in the films

microwave	The protostars will begin to glow first in the microwave and then in the far infrared 
microwave	In 1964 energy was observed coming from throughout the Universe this energy is seen as a feeble glow called the cosmic microwave background radiation . The glow was originally detected using radio receivers sensitive to the wavelengths of microwaves the same wavelengths utilized by radar or by microwave ovens . Is this glow the remaining energy from the Big Bang NASA Cosmic Background Explorer COBE and Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe WMAP were designed to provide the answer by measuring the properties of the microwave background radiation much more precisely than could be done with receivers on Earth

microwave	The cosmic microwave background shows us energy left over from those early years and this observable energy is taken as direct evidence for a very hot early Universe the kind of Universe expected after the Big Bang 
microwave	If this calculation is made for the time at which the cosmic microwave background was produced we find that portions of the Universe which could possibly have had time to communicate with each other were separated by less than 10 degrees in angular size on the sky 
microwave	Your answer for the time span between the production of the cosmic microwave background and the time of the first galaxy seen is the maximum time allowable for the transformation of the Universe from an evenly filled space of energy and matter to a space filled with galaxies

microwave	Light from the Big Bang is still with us today it is just shifted into the microwave portion of the spectrum 
microwave	Actually the microwave background is not 3 degrees everywhere and it is not perfectly uniform . In the direction of the earth movement the microwave background has a slightly bluer wavelength due to the Doppler shift . Conversely the microwave background in the direction opposite the earth movement has a slightly redder color

microwave	So if the beginning of the universe did emit optical light like a star that light would today be redshifted to much longer wavelengths the microwave region to be exact . In the early 1960 a group of Princeton astronomers attempted to build a microwave receiver to detect this light . While they were debugging their instrument two scientists working for Bell Labs about 30 miles away discovered that the microwave receivers they built for the phone company had excess noise in them . Tests showed that the excess microwaves were coming from anything specific such as the Sun or stars or the center of the Milky Way . It was as if microwaves were coming from all over the universe 
microwave	But if the Big Bang happened and the universe started out as a huge ball of gas how did we get the galaxies and clusters of galaxies that we observe today To answer that questions let return to looking at the 3 degree microwave background 
microwave	However the microwave background is not 3 degrees everywhere and it is not perfectly uniform . In the direction of the earth movement the microwave background has a slightly bluer wavelength due to the Doppler shift . Conversely the microwave background in the direction opposite the earth movement has a slightly redder color

microwave	New research by University of Warwick physicist Dr Gerard Hyland on the human body own electromagnetic radiation raises a host of new concerns and possibilities as to the effect of microwave radiation such as that generated by mobile phones radar or microwave ovens on the human body . If this is the case then serious questions arise about the effect of external sources of microwave radiation on living tissue and its own electromagnetic patterns . For instance much is known about how external microwaves can have a heating effect on living tissue and other substances . There are strict regulations and restrictions on the operation of things that could generate such a heating or thermal effect mobile phones and their masts microwave ovens etc but few have considered the possibility that these microwave sources could also have a non thermal effect on the bodies own microwave activity . If by unlucky chance one of these microwave pollutants matched one of the key microwave patterns of the human body the resultant resonance effect may be quite dangerous . In Russia where this knowledge of biophysics is more widely known manufacturers of microwave emitting devices such as leaking microwave ovens have safety precautions 1000 times more stringent than those in the UK and US just in case such an effect could occur

torch	She could see yet by the torch light as it had been fixed to the wall she could see the prayer in the frightened eyes she could feel the frantic struggle for breath perhaps for words which the pressure of those capable hands would not allow her to speak
torch	He knew not why he made this resolve which may have been from no better cause than the instinct that is common to men that they will be protected behind their backs but no one spoke in reply and they went out of the cave into the denser darkness of the tunnels beyond the torches flickering on the black walls and Tela leading the way 
torch	They were about at the point where they must turn to go back when Tela who talked to the King at times he being next behind her said that the pools that they passed in which the torches would shine as though the water were a surface of polished night were lower than she could remember to have seen them before 
torch	Plini he called and his voice had the ominous tone of one who has dreadful proof of that he had doubted long but which he will still not believe till it have been put to a final test cast your torch here I would see if there be more bones in this pool 
torch	It was a sudden merciless thrust and Tela torch shone on the point as it came out at the Queen back

torch	The walls of the cleft were steep and they moved with what silence they could seeking a place to climb and stumbling for lack of light the torches being put out lest they should invite those who were less than friends 
torch	There in the darkness that was lighted only by the tiny flames of the still burning torch that Og had clung to they waited 
torch	He did not realize that this marked him as being a higher type of human than any hairy man had ever been but he did know that an overmastering desire to help the struggling wolf dog swept away any selfish thoughts of his own safety and he sprang back toward the rear of the crevice dug the wolf dog from beneath the earth then gathering it under one arm and with the burning resinous torch in the other hand he began a mad scramble for the opening of the crevice 
torch	But as he breathed upon it the coals grew redder and hotter and suddenly a tiny flame appeared then another and another until the torch was rekindled 
torch	Og held the fast shortening pitchwood torch in his hand and pondered . He gathered more sticks and leaves in a pile then laid the burning torch among them 
torch	The cooling volcanic rock from which he had lighted his resinous torch first was also black 
torch	There he kept his precious tiger skin and the claws and teeth and there he kept choice pieces of wood that he hoped some day to make into torches his hammers for he had made several now that he had found an interest in making things his stone knives for he had wrought several of these with patient chipping and numerous pieces of flint that he had gathered up about the canyon . Always he sat on a smooth flat rock to work at his stone chipping and beneath this rock was a litter of stone chips and most conspicuous of all a pile of splintered wood some of it ground almost to powder as a result of his almost incessant beating of flint against wood and wood against flint in his vain hope of transferring the sparks from the stone to a torch 
torch	Then too for some curious reason he did not want even his own people to know that he possessed this fire torch . Then holding the burning torch at arm length as he had seen the hairy boy do he slipped into the forests and disappeared 
torch	Only a few moments longer did the tree people hesitate then with much squealing and pushing and shoving the whole tribe crowded inside and began to follow the hairy boy whose fire brand torch dispelled some of the blackness and showed them the way through narrow passages that led deeper into the bowels of the mountain where the air was free from smoke and cool and damp and delightful to their singed and badly burned bodies 
torch	It was a strange and weird procession they made as they traveled through the cave with the hairy boy ahead carrying his torch with its feeble rays only partly dispelling the gloom and throwing a weird light on the tribe of tree people strung out behind him chattering to each other and looking about in the darkness with fear in their eyes 
torch	But gradually with the help of Og torch their eyes became accustomed to the darkness and they could see from one end of the cavern to the other and to its great roof from which hung stalactites of tremendous length 
torch	Mostly they made for Og singling him out no doubt because of the flickering torch he held 
torch	Og threw off the fear of the great cavern first and while the tree folk huddled in a mass in the center of the cave and clung to each other for protection staring about them fearfully the hairy boy with his torch and the wolf cubs at his heels began to explore the great room

Testicular biopsy of the cryptorchid testis reveals decreased numbers of Leydig cells . Within the first 6 months of life the number of germ cells in the cryptorchid testis is within the normal range . By 2 years of age 38 of unilateral and bilaterally cryptorchid testes will have lost their germ cells . The descended testis in cases of unilateral cryptorchidism also may demonstrate abnormalities with low numbers of germ cells . The higher the cryptorchid testis the more severe the testicular dysfunction . Both mechanical and hormonal etiologic factors have been suggested to explain the mechanism of cryptorchidism . Histologic changes in cryptorchid testis within the first year of life has supported the therapy directed toward correction of cryptorchidism by 12 months of age .

torch	Lighting systems researchers at Berkeley Lab and the Sacramento Municipal Utilities District SMUD will work together under a cooperative research and development agreement to demonstrate the potential of compact fluorescent lamps developed here as a safer alternative to the halogen torchiere 
torch	The hazards and inefficiencies of halogen torchieres have long been a concern for Lighting Lab researcher Recently E Source estimates that the explosive growth of halogen torchiere use has essentially wiped out the energy savings of all compact fluorescent lighting . This spurred Siminovitch and Page to pursue design and testing of an compact fluorescent CFL version of the torchiere 
torch	and Boston how fire safety was enhanced when halogen torchiere light fixtures were replaced with alternatives at Northeastern University 
torch	The Lighting Systems Research Group is conducting ongoing research developing safe energy efficient alternatives to the ubiquitous halogen torchiere by employing various novel light sources in the torchiere fixture . One of our most successful designs is the CFL torchiere which recent won the Best of What New Grand Prize Award for Home Technology from Popular Science magazine . The CFL torchiere produces 25 more lumens than 300W halogen torchieres while using the energy and operating 5000F cooler 
torch	There has been a significant increase in sales of imported torchiere light fixtures in the American market resulting in a large increase in residential lighting energy use and a significant challenge to energy efficiency programs throughout the country .

torch	One type of fixture under development is a novel torchiere indirect uplight using a CFL . Preliminary studies measured these CFL torchieres photometrically and compared their performance to that of standard tungsten halogen sources . The Lighting Lab is in the process of setting up a consortium between large lamp ballast and fixture companies to produce a dedicated CFL torchiere which uses only 55 Watts of power but produces more light than its 300 Watt halogen counterpart 
torch	There has been a significant increase in sales of imported torchiere systems in the American market . Imports of torchiere systems have resulted in one of the largest increases in residential lighting energy use and represent a significant challenge to programs throughout the country 
torch	The halogen torchiere fixture is currently one of fastest selling portable fixture types in the United States . Recent studies have estimated that halogen torchieres are now consuming more energy than CFLs are saving in the U . We have produced a set of torchiere systems using efficient CFL sources and are optimizing them photometrically . While the initial price of the CFL torchiere will be around 35 more than halogen fixtures the total payback over the life of the fixture from energy savings will nearly 200 for a 300W halogen vs
torch	Photometric data shows that the standard halogen torchiere has an efficacy ranging from 2 to 12 lumens per watt LPW depending on the dimming level . Preliminary results indicate that the efficacy for compact fluorescent systems is 5 times that of the halogen torchiere at full power and increases to nearly 30 times the halogen efficacy as dimming occurs . An infrared thermograph camera was used to compare the CFL prototypes to the standard halogen torchiere see Figure 1

taxi	Sidgmore of MCI Worldcom scoffs at the notion that taxing online sales will crush the Web 
taxi	26 Each state that becomes a member is required to provide state level administration of all their sales and use taxes so that sellers only have to register with and remit tax returns and funds at the state level eliminating the need to interact with the various local taxing jurisdictions within a state . 27 The states are then required to distribute the taxes amongst the appropriate taxing jurisdictions . 28 To provide for an orderly transition the Agreement requires states with local taxing jurisdictions have a common tax base throughout all of the local jurisdictions through December 31 2005 . 33 Member states however bear the significant administrative burden as they must provide and maintain a database that describes boundaries for each taxing jurisdiction based on the five and nine digit zip codes 
taxi	One of the more important definitions is defining the taxing source . If no receipt address is available then the seller is allowed to use the shipped from address for its taxing source 
taxi	If states move to simplify their taxing structures then this argument becomes even stronger 
taxi	As differentiated in National Geographic the Internet has its connection with a taxing state exclusively by means of the instruments of interstate commerce 
taxi	Just as in GEICO if Congress enacts the proposed streamlined sales tax provisions of either HR 1410 or Senate Bill 512 then the courts would focus on whether their delegation of taxing authority was valid rather than the uncertain tests of substantial nexus and due process 
taxi	Internet taxing provides both advantages and disadvantages to vendors consumers and government entities 
taxi	Regarding intrastate retail sales taxes jurisdiction is satisfied when a purchaser buys property within the taxing state but use taxes on interstate commerce are not so easily imposed or collected 
taxi	The substantial nexus prong which has been interpreted by the Court as requiring a physical presence in the taxing state lxxxii has proven to be the most contentious of the prongs 
taxi	Some say that the Internet is a new medium unaffected and undefined by current law and that taxing it in its infancy would stunt its potentially limitless growth 
taxi	Whether the end result is a permanent tax moratorium on Internet access and sales or a compromise situation like the Streamlined Sales Tax Project where states may tax Internet sales to some degree Congress should seek to establish rules that are fair to traditional and online retailers state local and municipal taxing jurisdictions and easy to comply with and understand 
taxi	Intangible as well as tangible properties may give rise to sufficient presence to satisfy the nexus requirements for the taxing state 
taxi	It concerns the first part of the Complete Auto test and stands for the proposition that a vendor whose only contacts with the taxing State are by mail or common carrier lacks the substantial nexus required by the Commerce Clause . 14 Contrary to the State argument a mail order house may have the minimum contacts with a taxing State as required by the Due Process Clause and yet lack the substantial nexus with the State required by the Commerce Clause 
taxi	Nexus can be defined as a seller minimum level of physical presence within a state that permits the taxing authority to require the seller to register collect and remit tax and comply with the state taxing statutes and regulations 
taxi	19 Thus while it would seem that the states are clamoring for another source of income by taxing internet activities the states seem to be aware that they need to encourage access to the net by not taxing it for they are counting on the possible revenues 
taxi	It preserves state and local taxing authority with respect to income license and sales taxes 
taxi	The external consistency test looks to the economic justification for the State claim upon the value taxed that is fairly attributable to economic activity within the taxing State 
taxi	The court in Western Live Stock characterized a local state taxing event as an agreement payment and delivery of some of the service in the taxing State no other state can claim to be the site of the same combination 
taxi	This competitive advantage is their ability to sell products without taxing the purchaser . The states are not happy about this and are increasingly demanding that Congress do something to relax the nexus requirement that currently prevents states from taxing all goods purchased by their citizenry 
taxi	The segment then discusses three possible solutions to the current problems with taxing and concludes by embracing the national uniform sales tax method as the method most equitable to retailers and local retailers as well 
taxi	States are beginning to lobby Congress to make changes in the nexus definition that has traditionally kept states from extending there taxing authority outside of their borders 
taxi	Supreme Court held that while states may meet the Due Process requirement of minimum contacts under Commerce Clause requirements states may still be precluded from requiring retailers such as catalog companies and Internet merchants to collect taxes unless they have a physical presence in the state creating a substantial nexus with the taxing state 
taxi	Supreme Court held that that business did not need to have physical presence in state in order to permit a state to require the business to collect use tax from its customers but physical presence in the state was required for the business to have a substantial nexus with the taxing state under the Commerce Clause 
taxi	Those opposed to lifting the moratorium say forcing online merchants to comply with the taxing systems of thousands of jurisdictions will stifle development of the industry . Add to that the fact that online sales account for a small percentage of overall retail sales and moratorium supporters claim taxing an industry segment already weakened by a poor economy would be penny wise and pound foolish 
taxi	The gargantuan growth of the Internet and the revolution of the telecommunications industry in the Internet age with accompanying technological developments have resulted in a significant challenge to state and local taxing schemes 
taxi	A taxable transaction is not deemed to have occurred if the tangible personal property is ordered and mailed and delivered to a purchaser that is outside of Georgia because the presumption is that the jurisdiction where the property is received is the taxing jurisdiction 
taxi	These clauses provide that the requirement for state taxing jurisdiction is that there must be a concrete relationship or at least some minimal connection between the state and the taxpayer 14 . The term for the aforementioned relationship is nexus which refers to the justification of state taxing authority because a taxpayer or their activities derive the benefits or opportunities of transacting business within that state . If the state provides no benefit to the taxpayer then their taxing authority is not justified 
taxi	Does the taxpayer have minimum contact with the taxing jurisdiction so that they may be subject to tax 16 . And does a minimum contact exist between the taxing state and the activity that they seek to tax . The Supreme Court has held that not only must there be minimal contact between the taxpayer and the taxing state but a connection between the activity itself and the taxing state in order to establish jurisdiction 
taxi	Although these two questions are similar the difference between the two inquiries is extremely important when examined in relation to the constitutional limits of state taxing authority of 
taxi	If substantial presence requirements are met then the taxpayer is required to register with the taxing state collect use tax and distribute that tax to the taxing jurisdiction . The provisions of the Due Process Clause require minimal presence within the taxing jurisdiction for taxation to be constitutional and would allow a jurisdiction to require taxpayers provide information about their activities within the jurisdiction 
taxi	All of this coupled with the subjectivity of state application that may extend a state taxing authority to the limits of if not beyond constitutional restarints have many business and policy makers increasingly perplexed and concerned about the problems arising in the current and future digital age 
taxi	One of the main problems of taxation is the difficulty determining where the customer is located and whether the business or vendor has nexus with the taxing state or authority 
taxi	The above issues are just simple questions that arise from everyday operations yet these simple scenarios and transactions bring forth almost countless issues that threaten to disable current state and local taxing schemes or conversely to potentially oppress commerce if the current tax regimes are extended to allow for multistate taxation 
taxi	With the advent of the Internet the nature of the beast has changed and the apparent solution is to extend state taxing authority to encompass transactions 
taxi	A grandfather clause was incorporated to allow some states to continue taxing Internet access so long as the tax was generally imposed and actually enforced 51 on providers of the Internet before the date the moratorium was enacted 
taxi	Though the online business world supports the legislation state and local authorities are concerned about current and future impacts of their taxing power 
taxi	For this to work sophisticated technology would need to be employed as a tool as well as some standardization of state taxing schemes 
taxi	Instead of making the location of the customer the location of the taxing jurisdiction the taxing jurisdiction could be the location of the vendor 
taxi	The very core of the various taxing systems have been shaken by the revolutionary new economy and the way that business is being done in the digital age . The Supreme Court has put forth a standard for taxation that is commensurate with the Constitutional safeguards of Due Process and the Commerce Clause but even these standards can not give state and local taxing authorities the guidance to deal with taxation issues 
taxi	The federal government has sought to promote the growth of the Internet without significantly upsetting current state and local taxing systems by adopting and extending the tax moratorium provided by the Internet Tax Freedom Act

taxi	This plan is aimed at reducing the growth in government spending and taxing reforming and eliminating regulations which are unnecessary and unproductive or counterproductive and encouraging a consistent monetary policy aimed at maintaining the value of the currency 
taxi	It important to note that we only reducing the rate of increase in taxing and spending . We not attempting to cut either spending or taxing levels below that which we presently have 
taxi	The taxing power of government must be used to provide revenues for legitimate government purposes 
taxi	With the stick of a balanced budget amendment we can stop government squandering overtaxing ways and save our economy 
taxi	And there are so many things you want to do for those or this or that group so many programs many of them quite attractive and that can only be subsidized by more government taxing spending and borrowing 
taxi	Getting to the roots of unemployment meant fighting inflation and high interest rates caused by runaway government spending and taxing because we know that when inflation shoots up it triggers a rise in unemployment 
taxi	This time we going to keep inflation interest rates and government spending taxing and borrowing down and get Americans back on the job 
taxi	We have turned the corner from overtaxing overspending record interest rates high inflation and low growth 
taxi	So there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget 
taxi	Now I do think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich and not the other way around it just does work out that way 
taxi	If Harry Truman had to apply a motto to this radical taxing scheme he would have to say that Your buck never stops 
taxi	Mondale you are taxing my patience 
taxi	Some years ago an historian I believe said that every time in the past when a government began taxing above a certain level of the people earnings trust in government began to erode 
taxi	We suffering the structural problems of an industrial society that being transformed in many ways one of them into more of a service and information society as well as paying the price for years and years of big spending big taxing and overregulation in Washington 
taxi	We begun to undo the damage that the overtaxing overspending overregulating binge of the sixties and seventies inflicted on the American way of life and we made America respected in the world again 
taxi	In Chicago 1980 when I proposed an economic program which was the program we brought to Washington I said that we would try to bring taxing down to 20
taxi	Big taxing and spending had led to soaring inflation and interest rates government redtape had smothered productivity 
taxi	In closing just let me express that I have every confidence that we can control government spending taxing and in doing so ensure a lasting era of growth and opportunities for all our people 
taxi	After we come so far we must never turn back to the old destructive habits of taxing and spending 
taxi	Now at the end of this game today one team is going to be in a deficit situation and all those players are going to face a very taxing year in 1986 . Are you going to put the American people through the same experience in 1986 a taxing year
taxi	It might be taxing for me and my energy . But I do like the idea that someone might hear this and think I thinking of taxing them because I not 
taxi	Instead of taxing it away from local people and giving it back to them along with Federal guidelines and controls we left that revenue in local coffers and in your hands so you the people working with your local school boards can determine how your children will be educated 
taxi	Inflation is a hidden insidious way of taxing the American people 
taxi	As we strive to control taxing and spending we must also cut back government regulations that are anticompetitive excessively stringent or just plain unnecessary 
taxi	The confiscatory taxing of estates and inheritances has been halted as well 
taxi	An Federal Government with Federal Government big taxing and big spending does work never has worked and never will 
taxi	Our tax and budget cuts were the largest in history but they only reduced the rate of increase in taxing and spending 
taxi	The substantially expanded role of the Federal Government has been far deeper and broader than even the growing burden of spending and taxing would suggest 
taxi	This involves a commitment to reduce Federal spending and taxing as a share of gross national product 
taxi	Transfers of programs will permit public sector activities to be more closely tailored to the needs and desires of the electorate bringing taxing and spending decisions closer to the people 
taxi	To carry out these policies for the 1980s my Administration has put into place a series of fundamental and changes in Federal Government spending taxing and regulatory policy and we have made clear our support for a monetary policy that will steadily bring down inflation 
taxi	And they think that it is a way of taxing people on their savings and so forth 
taxi	We paying the price for years and years of big spending big taxing and overregulation 
taxi	But whether it cutting spending and taxing shrinking the size of the deficit ending overregulation inefficiency fraud and waste in government cracking down on career criminals revitalizing American education pressing for prayer and abortion legislation I think you can see that the agenda we put before America these past 2 years has been a conservative one 
taxi	Well ours were bombed and the result was with our taxing policies since the war we made it very difficult for American business to modernize plant and equal these other plants and be able to produce at the lower price that they could produce 
taxi	Big taxing and spending had led to soaring interest rates and inflation and our defenses had grown weak 
taxi	As far as I concerned we should never have been taxing widows like that in the first place 
taxi	We as Republicans have a bold vision for the future and unlike our opposition it not based on increasing government taxing spending regulating or inflating 
taxi	Through our block grant programs through our efforts to get control of Federal spending and taxing we halted what I consider to be a very ominous trend 
taxi	Big taxing and spending had led to soaring inflation and interest rates 
taxi	In 1981 when I first assumed the duties of the Presidency our Nation was suffering from declining productivity and the highest inflation in the postwar period the legacy of years of government overspending overtaxing and overregulation 
taxi	Government has been taxing and spending your earnings as though they are inexhaustible as though there need never be the kind of struggle to make ends meet that families undergo each week 
taxi	I proposed reducing marginal tax rates for individuals and businesses broadening the tax base by eliminating the majority of existing loopholes taxing different activities consistently so that resources are allocated on the basis of economic merit and not tax considerations and compensating for or eliminating much of the remaining influence of inflation on effective tax rates on capital 
taxi	That is why responsible Federal spending and taxing policies policies that foster growth and expand opportunity for all our citizens are so important 
taxi	The American taxing structure the purpose of which was to serve the people began instead to serve the insatiable appetite of government 
taxi	I promise you we going to hold the line on government spending and taxing so that inflation will never again become a nightmare for the working and retired people of America 
taxi	Washington has been on a taxing spree usurping tax sources that might better be left to local and State governments 
taxi	But you know as leaders of your major national organizations that too much taxing spending and control from Washington leads to bigger and bigger problems 
taxi	For those who are out of work and looking for jobs we cutting the excessive taxing and spending to open the way to more productivity and more employment 
taxi	Now we suffered a long painful recession brought about by more than a decade of overtaxing and spending and yes government intervention 
taxi	These proposals will expand opportunities by allowing parents to keep more of their own money rather than taxing it away to finance bigger bureaucracies 
taxi	A decade of overspending and overtaxing shot interest rates and unleashed devastating inflation on all of us 
taxi	Big taxing and spending had led to soaring interest rates and inflation 
taxi	Your 14 Republican Representatives have been a source of support vital to our efforts to get control of Federal spending and taxing and to reinvigorate the economy 
taxi	Even when a mayor tells you that a program with regard to transportation for the handicapped the way the government the Federal Government forced it on him so costly that he he could have sent taxicabs for every handicapped person that needed transportation and been money ahead if he been allowed to do that 
taxi	I often said that our country was in trouble because government was spending too much and taxing too much 
taxi	I think it would be a lot better if we get back to only taxing what should be our fair share and leaving you tax sources out there that you can use for problems which you see at your own level and have decided to do something about 
taxi	Senator Jackson well I can assure you I might as well say I do enjoy spending money that might have struck you already that that if it was absolutely essential to the security of our country my conservative philosophy would rebel at taxing money away from those who worked hard to earn it 
taxi	President we often hear local officials complain that your budget priorities force them to swallow Federal programs they ca afford so they reach their taxing limits and cut basic services 
taxi	And the Federal Government actually had acquiescence in that over a great many years by simply taking up so much of the taxing potential that not enough was left for local or State government for the things that they might want to do 
taxi	In other words reduce the increase in both government spending and taxing 
taxi	But one of the things that government taxing policies and government regulations excessive regulations did to these heavy industries and did to steel particularly was make it impossible for them to modernize and keep pace with some of the foreign building which did take advantage of modern technology and built more modern plants than we have 
taxi	It a reversion to politics as usual taxing and spending more and more of your money 
taxi	Here in America land of opportunity governments at all levels are taxing away 40 percent of our nation income 
taxi	You should know that these options include capping mortgage interest deductions eliminating deductions for State and local taxes in other words you pay a tax on a tax limiting charitable contributions for nonitemizers taxing part of the capital gains on home sales taxing fringe benefits and on and on and on 
taxi	Withholding 10 percent on interest and dividends will allow the Internal Revenue Service to recover an estimated 18 billion in otherwise lost revenues over the next 5 years and that without taxing honest taxpayers a penny more than they now pay 
taxi	Both the economy and the auto industry were in recession the culmination of years of overtaxing overspending and overpromising by those who claimed they could spend your earnings better than you could 
taxi	Irresponsible taxing and spending policies in the years prior to this administration gave us inflation and economic stagnation 
taxi	We ca go back to the same taxing and spending patterns of the last decade and expect that we will not also fall into the pit of recession inflation and stagnation from which we now just emerging 
taxi	So we will not have any gain at all by bringing down the deficit by taxing investment 
taxi	But I was just hypothesizing that suppose they came in with some entirely different form of taxation aimed at something different than income as a method of taxing 
taxi	Because as it is now and probably as a result of some of your taxing policies the incentive is more to saving than it is to consuming 
taxi	We could actually save money by putting them all in taxicabs 
taxi	This nation can no longer afford the big spending big taxing policies that have held sway for the last 20 years 
taxi	And the enterprise zone concept does rely on more Federal taxing and spending that approach has failed 
taxi	And the other day I had a very exciting experience when a Member of the Senate and a Member of the House walked into my office each presented me a letter each letter signed by enough men in the House men and women in the House and enough Senators to guarantee the upholding of any vetoes that I might take with regard to the taxing matters 
taxi	We doing other things that well we hope that under our economic program that we have helped small business with regard to taxing policies investment policies 
taxi	I think it has been the taxing policy plus inflation in our country over a number of years that has made it difficult for American business to modernize to bring plant and equipment up to date and thus keep pace with our overseas competitors . We continue to seek new ways in the taxing structure 
taxi	We have also in taxing that I think should be of help to anyone doing exporting overseas made some changes with regard to the inducements that you can offer for Americans who have to serve at least 11 out of 12 months of the year as employees of yours overseas 
taxi	You stood by us as we sought to reform the spending and taxing excesses that threatened to destroy the American dream 
taxi	Once again free enterprise is breathing life into our economy and we will not tolerate a return to the old ways of profligate spending and taxing that threatened to snuff it out 
taxi	But if our economy is to be vibrant enough to take full advantage of the future opportunities if we to compete with the economic powers now emerging in the Pacific we must follow responsible taxing and spending policies here at home 
taxi	Our woes were a direct result of going extremely wrong in our taxing policies big taxing big spending and inflation policies that we have been attempting to change 
taxi	It a formula for failure because we be taxing ourselves right back into a recession 
taxi	And President Donald Treadwell and David Roberts members of the board of directors before I say anything I want to take this opportunity to thank all of you for the support that you given our efforts over the last 3 years to cut spending and get taxing under control 
taxi	Big taxing and spending had led to soaring interest rates and inflation 
taxi	To paraphrase him When we start taxing individuals on any other basis than proportional to their earnings or property we are at sea without rudder or compass and there is no end to the mischief that can be done 
taxi	Republicans against the taxing and spending irresponsibility that shoved our country into the economic turmoil and decline from which we now just emerging 
taxi	Much of the economic turmoil we gone through can be traced directly to overspending and overtaxing 
taxi	America began a fundamental change in direction in 1981 a change from a policy of government promises a change from taxing you more no matter how hard you tried to rewarding you for working harder and producing more than before 
taxi	So we went to work to make a fundamental change in direction a change from control by government to control of government a change from taxing you more no matter how hard you tried to rewarding you for your work and for your working harder and producing more than ever before 
taxi	Those deficits ballooned from 50 years of government taxing and spending too much 
taxi	He not just helpful he been indispensable in our efforts to invigorate the economy get Federal spending and taxing under control and to strengthen America defenses 
taxi	And no one no level of government should be taxing more than is absolutely necessary 
taxi	And we think that the overall tax reduction that we giving the people in a way does something that I also have advocated for a great many years and that is that the Federal Government beginning back in the Depression days gradually preempted so much taxing authority that local and State governments found it impossible to go to the people for a tax increase that they might actually need for something necessary 
taxi	Excessive government spending taxing and regulating no matter how well intended is a formula for disaster 
taxi	But if we take into account Federal State and local spending and taxing our deficit is only 2 percent of gross national product 
taxi	I opposed to taxing for this problem or the solution to this problem because if you look back in history every major tax decrease has resulted in more revenues for the Government at the lower rates because of the stimulant to the economy 
taxi	We taxing at about the same level that has always been normal in this country 19 percent of gross national product are tax revenues 
taxi	And they in turn then had to turn to the Federal Government for help because they no longer had any sources they could go to for further taxing 
taxi	Let demand an economic bill of rights so that congressional taxing and spending can never again endanger our livelihoods 
taxi	Well today instead of taxing our citizens more heavily than those other countries our top Federal rate of 28 percent is the lowest most progrowth most competitive top personal rate of any of the leading industrial democracies in the world 
taxi	Tip really and sincerely and honestly believes in the philosophy which I once believed in and found I could no longer follow of taxing and spending and government trying to do things that I think are beyond government proper province 
taxi	America moving again but not by taxing the American people into the poorhouse . We only begun to wean ourselves from the long misery of overtaxing overspending and the great myth that our national nanny always knows best 
taxi	And I hope the people of Texas know that by electing Bill Clements they wo only be putting Texas back on the road to economic good times they also be sending a message to the rest of the country and especially to the Democratic Party leadership a message that says Stop the taxing stop the spending and help the administration in Washington make government live within its means 
taxi	Yet during the 1970 the Federal Government showed a disregard for this most fundamental form of property taxing it at higher and higher levels permitting inflation to raise effective tax rates again and again 
taxi	And I think the public temperature is going to rise even higher when it understands that Congress has been trifling with a plan to provide elderly Americans with insurance against catastrophic illness a plan that can work without taxing the elderly into servitude 
taxi	Federal spending and taxing were the order of the day 
taxi	It holds that it the job of government to intervene in the economy and to intervene constantly taxing regulating spending more and more of your dollars 
taxi	Political life is taxing long hours a great many pressures the need to be flexible in order to accomplish your goals 
taxi	These bills that I about to sign not every page this is the budget bill and this is the tax program but I think they represent a turnaround of almost a half a century of a course this country been on and mark an end to the excessive growth in government bureaucracy government spending government taxing 
taxi	And the purpose of this and it ties in so much with what we been trying to do in Washington because behind everything that Holmes was talking about behind all the changes in the budget and the taxing is the desire I had for so long to reverse course in this country and return us to a system that is so responsible for our freedom and that is that we are a federation of sovereign States 
taxi	Republicans have been a majority in the Senate now for a year and a half an important reason why we have been able to achieve such historic reversals of the big spending big taxing policies that got us into this recession . With their help we not only slowed the growth of government we cut it nearly in half the annual rate of spending increasing far greater than the annual rate of increase in revenues from our taxing system 
taxi	Our economic problems were a predictable result of decades of irresponsible government spending and taxing policies . And with your support we changed those taxing and spending patterns 
taxi	There are those who constantly are pushing to return to the disastrous taxing and spending patterns of the past and I hope I can count on you to stand with us to make sure that does happen 
taxi	All that big spending and taxing drained life and energy from the economy 
taxi	The basic reason for our economic troubles troubles from which we now just emerging is that for years government was spending too much and taxing too much 
taxi	He said the policies of the current Democratic nominee would cause a huge increase in spending and taxing 
taxi	We not tied to the failed policies of the past policies that relied on more taxing more spending and more government 
taxi	We for restoring discipline to the classroom the liberals are for increasing taxing and spending 
taxi	The liberals talk about jobs yet it was their taxing spending regulating and inflating policies that knocked the wind out of the private sector that provides those jobs 
taxi	Big taxing and spending had led to soaring interest rates and inflation and all over the world our nation was no longer known for strength and resolve but for vacillation and 
taxi	We do it by passing the veto the balanced budget amendment and limits on the congressional taxing power 
taxi	But what we experienced in the last decade was bloated government feasting at the expense of the people growing beyond all reason and taxing away the American way of life 
taxi	There are great pressures building to stop our economic program while it still taxing down the runway 
taxi	For the result of all that big spending and taxing is that today those at the lower end of the economic ladder are the hardest hit of all 
taxi	They no longer believed that throwing tax money at a problem was acceptable no matter how good the intentions of those doing the taxing and spending 
taxi	But somehow all that taxing and spending and regulating was making our values any stronger or our people any better off 
taxi	I just wish those who bear such a heavy burden for overspending and taxing us into this recession could resist playing politics with the problems they caused and work with us to stay on course to lasting recovery

The use of angiography and embolization to control problematic epistaxis has been well documented in other situations but its use in severe or recurrent epistaxis following irradiation for NPC has not been described . METHODS We retrospectively reviewed case notes of all patients with NPC initially seen with epistaxis over a period . Those patients with refractory epistaxis which could not be controlled by conventional methods and required angiography and embolization were assessed . CONCLUSION We conclude that embolization is a safe and effective method of controlling refractory epistaxis in patients irradiated for NPC

taxi	Taxi access for guide dog users Two vision impaired people complained that taxis at a major airport were refusing to take passengers accompanied by guide dogs . The complaint was settled when the state regulatory authority concerned advised that in immediate response to the complaint they were drafting a general directive to all taxi operators informing them of the relevant provisions of the local anti discrimination law and passenger transport legislation as well as the Disability Discrimination Act and noting the consequences of breaching those Acts 
taxi	Focus on response times The draft Disability Standards for Accessible Public Transport under the Disability Discrimination Act require that within 5 years from the authorisation of the Standards response times for accessible taxis should be the same as for other taxis 
taxi	It reflects HREOC view of the existing requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act and in fact is a substantial compromise from those requirements in that it refers only to booked services and not to taxis on ranks or hailed and thus in principle allows the taxi industry and regulators to comply by appropriate management of fleets having less than 100 accessible vehicles 
taxi	Consumer submissions to this Inquiry identify widespread problems of severely late arrival or non arrival of accessible taxis 
taxi	Private arrangements Despite these experiences it must be acknowledged that many users do receive an effective service from the taxi industry often achieved only through private arrangements outside booking systems 
taxi	Several States point out that these figures represent a much higher ratio of accessible cabs to WAT users than the ratio of taxis overall to general taxi users so that other reasons for less effective service need to be examined as well as simple numbers of cabs 
taxi	The difficulty of assessing whether there are sufficient accessible vehicles does not apply in those places where fleets include no accessible taxis at all . It is not acceptable that many regional towns with sizeable taxi fleets have no accessible taxi service 
taxi	The draft Standards include a requirement that response times for accessible vehicles are to be the same as for other taxis 
taxi	It has been submitted to HREOC in this inquiry that a requirement for equal response times on average for WATs as for other taxis both is economically unachievable fo rthe industry in present circumstances and misses the point that the greatest concern is not with what may be a small difference between average waiting times for WATs and for other taxis but with those smaller number of instances where WAT users face much longer delays or where a taxi never comes at all such as some examples given in consumer submissions 
taxi	Making recommendations for amendment of the Standards through the ongoing consultative processes established by the Australian Transport Council in which all States and Territories and the taxi industry are represented alongside consumers Applying to HREOC for an exemption under the DDA reflecting an approach to achieving compliance with the objectives of the DDA which may be better adapted to their own circumstances 
taxi	The focus of the draft Standards on waiting times for booked services as the key performance requirement for taxi services acknowledges in effect that for the present at least equal opportunity to hail cabs on the street is not required to be achieved for passengers requiring wheelchair accessible taxis 
taxi	Disability Council of NSW advised that several participants in community forums conducted by them reported delays of over four hours in waiting for accessible taxis and that all participants reported instances of waiting over an hour 
taxi	Several participants in hearings for this inquiry also gave evidence of similar incidents where children were stranded for some hours following sporting events while waiting for an accessible taxi 
taxi	A different form of delay due to insufficient effective supply of accessible taxi transport was noted in the submission of the Northcott Society based in western Sydney . This submission gave several instances of taxis which although they arrived on time to collect the passenger arrived over an hour late at the destination due to delay and diversion en route to collect multiple hires without any prior consultation with the original hirer 
taxi	It seems clear from submissions that in many parts of Australia wheelchair accessible taxi users do not receive a satisfactory transport service 
taxi	HREOC urges all jurisdictions to implement as a matter of urgency monitoring of wheelchair accessible taxi services against appropriate performance standards to publish regularly at least annually the results of monitoring and to consult with industry and community representatives on means of addressing any deficiencies in performance where these continue to be identified by monitoring 
taxi	Proportions of wheelchair accessible taxis in fleets Official national figures for accessible taxis were not provided to this inquiry 
taxi	This issue would of course be minimized if price differentials between standard taxis and accessible taxis were reduced sufficiently to require 100 fleet accessibility whether through lower license fees other forms of subsidy or technical developments 
taxi	Taxi Directorate notes for example that a smaller dedicated fleet would be likely to be able to provide a much more efficient service but that this would require a greater government contribution to provide a reasonable operator income in the absence of an ability to take general taxi fares 
taxi	Relationship of fleet proportions to service outcomes The discussion above indicates that there is considerably more to the issue of effective WAT service than the simple proportion of WATs in taxi fleets 
taxi	It is not acceptable that many regional towns even with quite sizeable taxi fleets have no accessible taxis . In these circumstances issuing of taxi licenses without requiring accessibility appears to involve particularly strong potential for liability under the DDA 
taxi	This should include examination of the impact of funding for community transport on the viability of accessible mainstream taxi transport and possibilities for redirection of funds from purchase of community transport vehicles to subsidising capital costs of accessible taxis in appropriate cases 
taxi	Where the specialist taxi regulator does not have a role regarding services transport authorities need to ensure by other means that appropriate attention is nonetheless given to regional service issues 
taxi	Industry representatives refer to additional capital costs for accessible taxis . The joint submission from the NSW Taxi Council and Victorian Taxi Association gives a figure of for a new standard taxi fully fitted with or more for an accessible taxi . They also make the point that the generally lower value of wheelchair accessible taxi licenses although a benefit in buying a license makes it more difficult to finance vehicle capital requirements 
taxi	In the Perth taxi market which is smaller than that for Sydney or Melbourne the approach has been to tendering for a single preferred WAT provider and to make the contract sufficiently economically attractive that there is an incentive to gain and keep the contract by meeting performance standards 
taxi	Other community submissions including the Physical Disability Council of Australia the Disability Council of NSW and the Australian Quadriplegic Association support further investigation of options for universal taxi designs and of barriers to their adoption in the Australian taxi market 
taxi	A very helpful submission from Dr Jack Frisch provided some economic analysis indicating that requiring all cabs to be accessible would be difficult to justify economically unless additional costs of accessible vehicles were to fall close to sedan taxi levels or unless a standard taxi design were adopted for other reasons in which case it ought to be an accessible design or unless the requirement were for equal results for hailing taxis on the street rather than for booked services which under the draft Standards it is not but which remains an available position for complainants to argue for under the existing discrimination provisions pending authorisation of Standards 
taxi	Federal State and Territory transport regulators to consideration of issues of appropriate universal taxi design or designs and means of having such a design or designs enter service as a substantial part of Australian taxi fleets 
taxi	Single design or several designs of accessible vehicle A number of submissions refer to economies of scale in adopting a single accessible taxi design 
taxi	Marketing of accessible vehicles for mainstream use Although submissions do not address this issue directly there is a possibility that in addition to issues with the suitability of current vehicle designs some of the reported reluctance of general taxi users to use WATs may be not because of prejudice against people with disabilities and hence against use of vehicles associated with disability but because of a desire to give priority to people with disabilities or potentially a belief that vehicles marked with the accessibility symbol are reserved exclusively for disability use 
taxi	Consumer submissions to this Inquiry identify widespread problems of severely late arrival or non arrival of accessible taxis 
taxi	For example taxi subsidy schemes and disability parking permits need not extend to all people with a disability as defined in the DDA since not all forms of disability involve the same issues of mobility and transport disadvantage 
taxi	Similarly consideration by the Inquiry of the effectiveness of measures by taxi regulators in different jurisdictions to provide incentives for provision of accessible taxi services could be useful 
taxi	Accessibility of buses is substantially lower but has begun to be implemented with around 6 now accessible 7 of metropolitan taxis are accessible nationally and 9 of Close to 100 of metropolitan rail carriages provide some degree of access even if not in full compliance with the Standards The figure for rail carriages is lower but still exceeds the first 5 year 25 target 
taxi	Continued implementation of accessibility for buses trains trams rail stations and tram stops to meet the targets in the standards Improved coordination at local and State levels to ensure accessible transport services are matched with accessible local infrastructure including bus stops and access paths connecting with rail stations Improved performance monitoring and other measures potentially including improved economic incentives for introduction and operation of accessible vehicles which may be identified as effective in relation to taxis to deliver the requirement of equal response times for accessible taxis Means of providing access for passengers using wheelchairs regarding regional and rural air services 
taxi	In the area of physical access to taxi services the standards take a different approach to that adopted for other modes . Rather than requiring all taxis to be accessible they require only that response times for accessible taxis should by the end of the first five years be the same for accessible taxi bookings as for other taxis bookings . Requiring all taxis to be accessible was assessed as prohibitively expensive when the standards were developed and as not required to achieve equal access at least to booked services 
taxi	Indications to HREOC inquiry were that if a fully accessible taxi fleet is required to provide equal access to services this would still require significant economic support from government to achieve 
taxi	A number of jurisdictions have adopted revised performance monitoring and other measures recently but it remains to be seen how far these will be effective to secure reasonably equal access to taxi services 
taxi	HREOC conducted an inquiry back in 2003 on taxi response times to promote discussion of some of these issues 
taxi	Despite this the review of the Standards offers an important opportunity for a look nationally at what regulatory changes might better promote provision of accessible taxi services and we encourage industry and community organizations to bring forward ideas for this purpose 
taxi	Another may need the same flexibility because of unpredictability of when an accessible taxi will actually arrive despite the improvements I have mentioned in transport access 
taxi	Another may need the same flexibility because of unpredictability of when an accessible taxi will actually arrive despite the improvements I have mentioned in transport access 
taxi	However it has been less effective in relation to taxis and in regional areas 
taxi	We do point to some areas where progress is less clear including information aspects o transport services accessible taxi services rural and regional air services and coordination of accessible transport with local infrastructure as well as indications that access outside city centres would be achieved faster with improved incentives for accessible services In our submission we discuss the delay in getting transport standards in place 
taxi	A person using a wheelchair waiting in the rain for an accessible taxi which has not turned up on time has even more need than other people for a phone to find out what is happening or to contact work or family the explain the delay 
taxi	The reason for that is that mostly we expect buildings to last much longer than a bus or a taxi and that access defects of an old building can be expensive and difficult to change 
taxi	As well as representatives of all Transport Ministers the Taskforce included representatives of the bus and coach and taxi industries and a number of representatives of people with a disability 
taxi	It would be unreasonable to restrict access to trains ferries taxis etc over an accessway constriction on buses 
taxi	5 X above submissions object to the proposed clause indicating that passengers are responsible for stowage etc of mobility aids noting that as drafted it appears to cut across existing obligations at least in relation to taxis 
taxi	For example in recent years the commission has dealt with complaints in relation to the accessibility of existing rail carriages the question of scooters being permitted on buses access to suburban railway stations wheelchair access to local buses wheelchair seating on coaches air travel with oxygen people requiring assistance animals on trains railway station toilet facilities taxi access for guide dog users sleeping carriage access accessibility of Perth buses access to interurban trains and main terminal station access to public transport buses and access in country trains 
taxi	The first was a 1996 study by Maag et al 5 exhibit S which showed more crashes for taxi drivers with binocular vision problems compared with healthy ones but not more severe in terms of the number of victims . Dr Westlake said that the Maag study provided a very good analogy because taxi drivers would be driving quickly and impatiently wanting to get the next fare 
taxi	For example a Deaf person could not expect to complain successfully of the inaccessibility of the music output of a CD player any more than a railway is required to provide door to door taxi service for people who can not travel the distance to stations because of disability 
taxi	This handover capability is what distinguishes mobile telephony from traditional radio telephony such as we know from taxi radios 
taxi	Another participant spoke of her grandson who has ataxic cerebral palsy 
taxi	Key examples include teaching nursing casino workers taxi drivers and bus drivers 
taxi	An example was given of an aged person who was discharged at night and sent home in a taxi despite the fact that no care was properly available to him 
taxi	There are no access taxis and no buses at all let alone buses with wheelchair access 
taxi	Older people have a special deal for taxies but the phone call has to go to Whyalla and then back to Port Augusta 
taxi	In one case a young girl with an intellectual handicap was inappropriately dropped off at our service by a taxi at 12
taxi	That means that where other people can take the bus people with disabilities need to take a taxi and the cost of that is up to three times greater 
taxi	One woman told us An elderly man was discharged at night and sent home in a taxi despite the fact that no care was properly available to him 
taxi	It has also advocated for bills statements correspondence and public issue documents to be provided in accessible formats in education discrimination cases employment discrimination for accessible buildings independent voting rights more accessible websites and ATM and for people denied service in restaurants and taxis and rental accommodation because they are accompanied by guide dogs 
taxi	The Standards apply to trains planes buses ferries and taxis 
taxi	I am concerned that the Commission continues to hear about Indigenous people being denied rental properties service in shops taxi rides and employment simply because they are Indigenous 
taxi	The Taxi Inquiry was prompted by the number of formal complaints and informal representations to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission regarding delays or unreliability in taxis services for people with disabilities who require taxis to be wheelchair accessible . Written submissions to the taxi inquiry closed on 3 July 2001 and the Commission is now conducting public meetings to gather further information 
taxi	The issues on which the Commission is seeking comment include response times for passengers requiring wheelchair accessible taxis the current proportion of wheelchair accessible taxis measures taken by transport authorities to ensure that a sufficient proportion of taxi fleets is accessible whether a universal taxi approach is necessary or desirable whether a dedicated taxi service is necessary or desirable economic disincentives to provision of wheelchair accessible taxi services effective use of accessible fleets and a range of other issues 
taxi	Commissioner Dr Sev Ozdowski who will be conducting the inquiry said he wanted to get a full and balanced picture of the issues across Australia affecting equality of access to taxi services for people who need wheelchair accessible taxis 
taxi	The Commissioner conducted a Public Inquiry on aspects of wheelchair accessible taxi services during the second half of 2001 
taxi	The Inquiry found evidence that response times were significantly longer for passengers requiring wheelchair accessible taxis than other passengers making taxi bookings in some parts of Australia . It was not possible to judge conclusively whether numbers of accessible vehicles in taxi fleets overall need to increase to achieve equitable service because most jurisdictions did not have or had only very recently established adequate performance monitoring for accessible taxis 
taxi	As someone with a physical disability who uses a motorised wheelchair and relies on the taxi service to enable me to travel I have had to endure countless experiences of inadequate service . People with disabilities should not have to wait for hours longer than others for a taxi 
taxi	At am a taxi had not arrived so I rang CBS and asked for an estimated time of arrival 
taxi	At a taxi arrived 1 hour and 10 minutes after the requested and agreed upon time . I had to present last and was so distressed by the earlier experience with the taxi service that it resulted in my presentation being severely impaired . Had my taxi arrived on time I would have made a much more positive impression 
taxi	My experience brings me to the conclusion that one has to be pragmatic when considering what further reforms can be made in taxi transport for people with disabilities 
taxi	Personally I get around the problem of response times by always making my bookings privately with the same taxi driver 
taxi	While I recognize that the private bookings option will not be available to all taxi travellers it also shows the impractical nature of trying to monitor an enforcement policy 
taxi	It may be one reason why licences only specify that priority my italics be given to disabled people It might be necessary to seek an exemption for WAT taxis from competition policy 
taxi	However to pick up on my earlier point if we are serious about improving taxi services we should look beyond the Commission own legislative framework 
taxi	Questions of deployment and numbers of special taxis will need to include a financially realistic appraisal of cost and benefit which is credible politically 
taxi	Finally I think much can be done to improve efficiency and economic costs by reforming the legal structure of the taxi industry and the Passenger Transport Act . As this relates to the provision of accessible taxis and taxis in general please see the Disability Council submission and the heading Reforming the taxi industry legal framework on Page 4 
taxi	All seems to be working well as it is relatively easy to apply to your state Transport Department for interstate taxi travel subsidy dockets 
taxi	The current interstate dockets have numbers nominating a specific state in which they were issued and an equally specific state in which they can be handed to taxi driver 
taxi	In my opinion it is time that the taxi subsidy scheme was so reformed . It is slow and paper intensive in the modern day it should not take weeks for a taxi driver to be paid a part fare 
taxi	On a recent trip to Melbourne I discovered that while the NSW Transport Department could provide me with dockets suitable for use in Victoria this was news to Victorian taxi drivers 
taxi	Finally I can not emphasise enough my concern about the universal taxi option 
taxi	0 pm Melbourne Central staff informed me the Sandringham line was closed temporarily because of tree damage to a train and advised me to go to South Yarra station where I would be able to finish my journey by wheelchair accessible bus or taxi . The station master said she would a taxi 
taxi	Bayside staff did check there was a booking for a wheelchair accessible taxi but were unable to determine when or if a taxi would arrive . 0 pm on my last call to CBS I asked if they could book a taxi instead 
taxi	Thank you for this opportunity to express my concerns regarding the dismal state of the taxi system here . Below I have highlighted my experiences with the Australian taxi system both while on vacation here in 1997 and to the present as experienced now as a resident 
taxi	Most of my taxi experience was in Sydney and it was mostly bad . It was also my first chance to meet my who lived in South Coogee but because of the taxi system more on this later we never met and she passed away in 1999 thanks so much 
taxi	Although I always asked for Maxi taxis as they were the only ones I truly can sit up straight in only got one once while in Sydney . Wait Wait Then the hotel staff they were great Park Lodge Hotel brought out the cordless phone with the taxi dispatch on the line . Well this went on from am to 3 pm with dispatch telling me every half hour another 30 mins another 10 mins or can we send a London cab Well this was the day my wife and I were planning to visit mum but at 3 pm we canceled as we had a dinner engagement later in the day only to have a taxi turn up a half hour later with a rather POed driver after he was told we had canceled the trip and also telling him to take out his anger on dispatch . I will never NEVER forgive the taxi companies Sydney nor the state and federal governments of Australia for allowing such a condition to exist in this day and age 
taxi	As for Brisbane both Maxi taxis turned up on time though the first had to be yelled at to stop the cab and to stop driving like a fool as I was being tossed all over the back and then to come back here and tie my chair down properly . The driver who took us to the airport the next morning 5 am was I must say provided one of the smoothest most comfortable taxi rides I ever had 
taxi	Lack of accessible public transport IMHO is the worst offender with taxi services and I use services lightly doing their fair share to make transport for PWD very difficult indeed 
taxi	I use the taxi coupons the state hands out to all qualifying disabled who ask 
taxi	Well these are my taxi complaints after 3 weeks visiting in and the 10 months as a resident since migrating and I do even take taxis that often any wonder Sorry for taking so long but this is not a one paragraph issue from anyone who remotely used the system 
taxi	I would like to know why people who work for Endeavour are entitled to taxi vouchers and people who are less disabled are not I would like to also know why some people are approved for taxi vouchers through their doctor and others more in need are not
taxi	I own a Wheel chair accessible taxi . I have owned this taxi for about 18 months prior to this I drove a wheel chair accessible taxi for about 8 years hence I consider that I am a very experienced driver and have a lot to offer in terms of an industry point of view 
taxi	First the idea that WATS operate as normal taxis and give priority to wheelchair work is a concept that opens up all sorts of problems and an obvious conflict of interest . I do think you can blame taxi drivers for taking what they consider the easiest and most profitable work and I feel it is important to emphasize here what the driver considers to be the easiest and most profitable work . That human nature and it is also a culture strongly imbued in taxi drivers who are work on their own and compete amongst themselves for the best work 
taxi	However by failing to inform the VDT and going public they incense the taxi drivers the vast majority of whom are doing the right thing by tarnishing their reputation while doing nothing to address the behavior of errant drivers 
taxi	As a of nearly ten years who does not drive I rely heavily on taxis . I am often forced to plan my life around taxis and experience significant monetary and personal costs because of them 
taxi	Generally I have to say that the taxi drivers who pick me up are more helpful than not and often apologise for their response time with many saying they have traveled a vast distance to pick me up because no one else answered the radio call 
taxi	It is vital to me that this inquiry result in expanded quality taxi services for people in wheelchairs . I need taxis to be reliable and safe so I can live my life . I want to be able to go out at night and not worry that I will be stranded waiting for a taxi at a late hour . I want to be able to book a taxi and know it will arrive on time and not have to waste an hour waiting and ringing the call center to remind them I still waiting 
taxi	Cairns wheelchair action group is a informal group of wheelchair accessible taxi users and approximately 20 in number roughly equally split between users and providers . Hence our recent meetings in this year to question the local taxi company and Queensland Transport on the failure to carry out the commitments given to us in last year as well as to put together a submission to this inquiry 
taxi	The group was formed due to the perceived misinformation that was being feed to both the users and providers of the wheelchair taxis by the relevant power authorities both local and state 
taxi	The drivers knew they were not the prime cause of the poor service as evidenced by some users wishing to use private bookings through mobile telephones knowing then they would have their taxi 
taxi	In 2000 when it became clear the report on the inquiry into wheelchair taxis in Queensland conducted by a senior project officer of Queensland Transport Mr Liam Mckay was to be suppressed we had a series of meetings . This resulted in a forum meeting in Cairns on 3rd November attended by users owners and drivers of the taxis as well as local politicians taxi company directors management and Queensland Transport local Townsville and Brisbane led by the Director of Public Transport . Further promises were given by Queensland Transport that a review would be completed and we would be given results in January 2001 as to what was the optimum wheelchair taxi fleet numbers required in Cairns to meet the contracted Minimum Service Levels 
taxi	Cairns taxi fleet consists of 127 vehicles 12 of which are licensed to give priority to wheelchair bookings 2 others have the capacity but the company does not inform them of any outstanding work on a regular basis . There is also one taxi that is accessible which is hired out at a higher rate when replacing a wheelchair taxi than if it was replacing a standard licence taxi 
taxi	WE see the wheelchair accessible fleet numbers as being clearly inadequate to meet the minimum service levels of the taxi contract which was meant to give a form of equality of service to all users . However we do see the need for more taxis just a greater percentage of the fleet being wheelchair accessible it has been suggested this may be at least 33 . This is somewhere near the figure we now have of Maxi taxis we believe these taxis do pick up near the minimum service levels 
taxi	One suggestion in Liam Mckays report calls for a tender system whereby ordinary licences could be converted to accessible a second suggestion is all maxi taxis should be accessible and work within the accessible fleet 
taxi	Over recent times users of wheelchair taxis are changing over to pre booking a taxi rather than put a call through when it is required . This means planing your day in advance and sticking to it a situation not faced by most taxi users unless there are appointments or air planes to catch . This booking process has a secondary affect within the taxi fleet . Instead of time bookings being issued 5 minutes prior to booking time they are issued 10 minutes early for wheelchair customers and in effect this gives the taxi company 20 minutes to get the taxi to the customer within the 10 minute minimum service level 
taxi	There has been a large drop in taxi demand which coincided with these fare increases resulting in the taxis sitting around vacant for much longer periods than normal . Improvements in the taxi company job dispatch procedures 
taxi	One wheelchair fare cost nearly double for two students in a wheelchair than it did for the same distance in a taxi 
taxi	We did only have 4 wheelchair taxis but I think that that has increased to 10 in the Hunter . However it is difficult to access taxis when needed . The teenager in the wheelchair had to wait till evening before we could get an accessible taxi for her 
taxi	A sub issue is that families with children pre 16 years of age do not receive mobility allowance or receive any tax rebate for registration of special vans to accommodate electric wheelchairs therefore they are even more financially deprived yet often more dependent on taxi services through not being able to afford a van and costs of taxis therefore must seem to hit them harder 
taxi	I had attended a transport meeting in the city and booked a taxi to take me on the return trip to Weemala Ryde . At 4pm I rang the taxi firm as my ride had not showed up . I continued to ring until the taxi finally arrived at 7
taxi	There are more types of accessible taxis available now . I believe that the different vehicles should be classified so that individuals can know what type of taxi they can fit into and make sure when they book that they get this type . Recently I booked a taxi and when it arrived it was the new Mercedes style 
taxi	The Spastic Centre welcomes the opportunity to provide comment on the issue of wheelchair accessible taxi services . The Physical Disability Council of NSW has provided a detailed submission on the issues and inequities in relation to taxi transport for people with disabilities . We fully support this submission and emphasise the need for universally accessible taxi transport . Having a small number of taxis that are specifically modified perpetuates discrimination within the community . If disability is to be regarded as falling inside the usual spectrum of community experience then all taxis need to be accessible to all members of the community . The stigma of the disabled taxi needs to be removed . Additionally a discriminatory practice which must be addressed is the financial burden imposed on people with disabilities by the cost involved in the time needed for them to enter and leave the taxi . A possible solution to this issue is the payment of a subsidy to the taxi operators to cover this additional cost which is not incurred by non disabled passengers 
taxi	Several of our clients have to rely on transportation by taxi and as a result have added restrictions placed on their ability to access services and activities of their choice due to the unreliability of the taxi service 
taxi	However my mine problem lies in catching a taxi in Melb . Given the fact that it is so hard to book a taxi I was forced to get a wc from Geelong to drive me to Melb wait around for a hour drive me back 
taxi	Afterwards I rang up the 8332 0200 taxi booking number and spoke to a supervisor at the time it was after business hours . The supervisor said she believed that all taxi drivers were allowed to decide for themselves when they stopped the meter and that it was perfectly legal . I rang Harry Ulman the next day who said quite clearly that according to the Department Of Transport all taxi meter must stop when the car stops at its destination . Although I was legally correct Mr Ulman then continued to say that he was personally not in favor of this ruling and that he felt it would deter taxi drivers from picking up wheelchair bookings . On some occassions when I have been in a rush to go I have even offered to pay a small extra amount to cover the cost of unloading but these taxi drivers refuse to accept my money until they have completed everything including closing the door and then slowly walking to the driver seat to find out what the meter states 
taxi	I believe that since the time I have spoken to Mr Ulman the Department of Transport has issued a letter to all NSW taxi owners reminding them of this ruling 
taxi	Hopefully improvements to the taxi industry will be made in the future 
taxi	Another situation occurred on a Sunday when a carer rang up to make a booking for his Son in a wheelchair and was informed by the company that they do not manage the Disabled people taxi on a Sunday and he would need to contact the other cab company in the area 
taxi	Surely people issued with disabled taxi licence should have to pick up a booking for this group of people over an able bodied person and they should be held accountable 
taxi	It is widely known in the taxi Industry that if you belong to TCS you will get priority on the work therefore receive better quality work 
taxi	Finally it is my opinion that increasing the number of wheel chair accessible taxis would not translate in better service levels but rather would serve as an avenue for more drivers to enter the wheel chair taxi industry as a cheaper option with absolutely no regard to the needs of the community they ought to dealing with 
taxi	I personally have not had a bad experience with disabled taxis but know of friends who have 
taxi	The cost of taxi travel for those who can not catch public transport even if accessible must be revisited 
taxi	Firstly the number of accessible taxis seems to have increased overall and in particular in our area postcode 2121 
taxi	My son can not use Metro vehicles as his overall height in the power drive chair is too great for this type of taxi 
taxi	It is easier to get a taxi into the city than to places within the local area 
taxi	My son can not easily catch an accessible taxi from a rank . There is no way that he is able to hail a taxi passing by . He has experienced accessible taxis driving away rather than picking him up . He has to pay a booking fee for almost every taxi ride he takes 
taxi	The quota of wheelchair passengers per accessible taxi seems very low and the reality is that a proportion of the drivers do the bulk of wheelchair jobs . In effect this reduces the number of accessible taxis on the road at any time that are actually available to wheelchair users 
taxi	I have stopped using wheelchair taxis because of the poor service and expense . Of course this means I have to use my manual instead of my electric wheelchair when I go out as I have to get standard taxis 
taxi	In Tasmania there is no public transport for wheelchair users only access taxis 
taxi	The taxi industry in Adelaide currently consists of 920 general taxis and 68 access taxis a total of 988 . The proportion of access taxis to total taxis is almost 7 . Surprisingly a similar percentage is not reflected when we examine the proportion of access customers to total access and taxi customers 
taxi	If the general taxi industry can cope with its customers to the point of providing a response time of six minutes why can not the access cab sector service its customers as efficiently when they have 2
taxi	When there is an increased demand for its services in one specific area the probability of having a vacant vehicle in the vicinity to cater for future bookings would be quite less than that for general taxis which belong to larger fleets that provide a wider net of customer coverage 
taxi	Loading times for wheelchair customers are longer than that of the general taxi industry and therefore it could be argued that access taxis have a lower propensity to perform as many jobs per day as the general taxi . This implies that during peak demand periods access taxis can not service their customers as adequately as general taxis 
taxi	If we increase the level of access taxi plates in order to spread a wider net of coverage for access customers this may reduce waiting times but may also have a negative impact on the access taxi sector . More licenses would decrease driver income which in turn will eventually lead to a poorer service and a reduction in the supply of properly trained access taxi drivers 
taxi	Suburban radio network systems in the same access taxi and it is highly unlikely that at least one general radio system is not represented in an access vehicle . Without doubt a general taxi booking is a desired commodity for the access taxi driver 
taxi	This desire may be at the core of the access taxi problem and may also explain why there are no access taxis present in Adelaide Independent Taxis Adelaide largest taxi company that prohibits access taxis from general taxi work from 6a 
taxi	This involves all general taxis to be transformed into UWAT . We do not recommend this option as we believe the problem with the access taxi sector lies in its operation . Apart from the fact that transforming all taxis into UWAT would be an incredibly expensive exercise we must be careful not disadvantage the general public in relation to consumer choice 
taxi	The introduction of UWAT while possibly reducing waiting times in non peak periods for people with wheelchairs would compromise the choices of the taxi consumer and would probably lead to a long term reduction in demand for general taxi services 
taxi	From all available data stressing that this data provides only a small sample of the access taxi sector and is over two years old we conclude that the solution to the higher relative waiting times an average of 6 minutes for general taxis and an average of 12 minutes for access taxis for people in wheelchairs lies in the fundamental principles of operation of general taxi radio networks that allow access taxis to use their services during the most important hours for the access customer 
taxi	On 5 April 1997 he sent a further memo to Acting Sergeant Mills explaining in some detail why he did not believe that he should be obliged to refund the cost of the taxi fares 
taxi	She did concede that she was offered Cab Charge vouchers by the Health Service and that Ms Perkons had suggested she caught a taxi directly to the Health Service and from there to her home 
taxi	She discussed with Ms Sluggett these issues of access and suggested she used either a government car or taxi voucher for this purpose but Ms Sluggett refused these 
taxi	The complainant who is a member of each of the respondent Masonic Lodges suffers from a condition known as Cerebellar Ataxia as a result of which he has an uneven unbalanced and unsteady gait 
taxi	Once a person leaves school a person is faced with the difficulties associated with inaccessible public transport and taxis and negotiating the combination of the Mobility Allowance transport concessions and taxi subsidies 
taxi	The lack of covered waiting bays at taxi ranks also has the same effect 
taxi	Also many such students are compelled to use a taxi service as the main mode of transport to and from the institution 
taxi	The special taxi scheme was reported to be unreliable and haphazard . Stories abounded of taxis being late turning up on the wrong days drivers being rude and some allegedly taking visitor routes to destinations especially if the passenger was perceived as having an intellectual disability . Nevertheless many of the expenses paid by taxi passengers with disabilities would not be experienced and certainly not endured by people 
taxi	According to users of the service it is not uncommon to wait two to three hours for a taxi which was often booked the night before or is the subject of a regular booking 
taxi	There are no special purpose taxis 
taxi	Another family has a child with severe asthma forcing them to spend their limited Centrelink funds on emergency taxi visits to the Children Hospital
