bucket	method that tried to manipulate the bucket brigade or the bucket 
bucket	A bucket represents a chunk of data 
bucket	The stream of data is represented by bucket brigades 
bucket	the presented bucket brigade has passed through several filters some buckets were removed some modified and some added 
bucket	to read and write the data and the second using bucket brigades to accomplish the same and allow for connection filters
bucket	at the same module but this time implemented by manipulating bucket brigades and which runs its output through a connection output
bucket	The handler receives the incoming data via bucket bridges one at a time in a loop 
bucket	pass the whole brigade unmodified without even looking at the buckets 
bucket	These data chunks are stored in buckets which form bucket brigades 
bucket	bucket brigades behind the scenes it still important to understand bucket brigades 
bucket	Filters get invoked as many times as the number of bucket brigades sent from an upstream filter or a content provider
bucket	assumption that the EOS bucket is arriving alone in a bucket brigade 
bucket	extra bucket brigades or collect all the data in all bucket brigades passing through it and send it all down in
bucket	the beginning of the token will come in the next bucket brigade on the next filter invocation 
bucket	performed at the beginning of the handler and the EOS bucket was sent in together with the data the EOS event
bucket	brigade is requested from the upstream filter or when the bucket brigade is passed to the downstream filter 
bucket	and output filters differ in the ways they acquire the bucket brigades which includes the data that they filter 
bucket	call which in turn applies its modifications and sends the bucket brigade to the next filter etc
bucket	modperl provides two interfaces to filtering a direct bucket brigades manipulation interface and a simpler interface 
bucket	immediately link it to the bb variable which makes the bucket brigade available to the next input filter when the filter
bucket	output mode the bb variable already points to the current bucket brigade 
bucket	header is put into a separate brigade with a single bucket 
bucket	So far all the buckets were of the HEAP type meaning that they were allocated
bucket	The request filter sees a bucket brigade with a single bucket of type TRANSIENT which is allocated from the stack memory
bucket	Create a new empty bucket brigade ctxbb pass it to the upstream filter via getbrigade
bucket	to the upstream filter so it will be populated with buckets 
bucket	Both techniques allow addition and removal of buckets 
bucket	this filter handler we have used the first technique of bucket brigade modification 
bucket	ask yourself why did we have to go through the bucket brigades filters when this all can be done so much
bucket	It only possible to get more than one bucket brigade from the same filter handler invocation if the filter
bucket	line may be split between across two or even more bucket brigades so we have to store the unprocessed string in
bucket	The bucket brigades output filter version is just a bit more complicated
bucket	bucket which is inserted to the end of the new bucket brigade 
bucket	It quite possible that reading one bucket brigade is not enough 
bucket	realizes that it does have enough data in the current bucket brigade it can store the read data in the filter
bucket	bb the input filter can initiate the retrieval of extra bucket brigades until the underrun condition gets resolved 
bucket	only three times instead of six times there were six bucket brigades 
bucket	least one complete token the tokens are put into a bucket brigade and returned to the upstream filter for processing keeping
bucket	module we use flattenbb to read the data from the buckets and signal when the EOS is received 
bucket	If a filter desires to store the incoming buckets for post processing 
bucket	good idea to ask at least 8k so if a bucket brigade has 8k nothing will need to be stored in
bucket	a file handle can be put in a bucket and the read from the file can be postponed to
bucket	DECLINED and modperl will take care of passing the current bucket brigade through unmodified to the next filter in chain 
bucket	brigade behind the scenes and reads data from all its buckets 
bucket	After the EOS bucket is read the filter should expect not to be invoked
bucket	the EOS bucket to the next filter ignoring any other bucket brigades that may have left to consume 
bucket	The issue is that buckets from one request may get buffered and not sent during
bucket	all of the buckets in the brigade and putting new buckets into it later
