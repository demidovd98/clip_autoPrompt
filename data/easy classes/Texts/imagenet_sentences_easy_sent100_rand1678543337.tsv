cucumber	b'Tomatoes are rich in so many good things including vitamin C lycopene and assorted carotenes that eating them every day is a good idea especially now while local ripe tomatoes are at their peak . Here are ideas for serving tomatoes in a variety of ways . Delicious now they will be even more welcome when tomatoes need a flavor boost . With their thick sweet flesh round cherry and oval grape tomatoes can be a better choice than the regular kind because even if bought at the supermarket they taste good year round . They great for adding color to a green salad but they also do well on their own .

Think of adding diced mango jicama cucumber or other produce when making a salsa . A freshly made salsa richly textured with many ingredients can be so irresistible that your family members will each eat a whole cup providing a healthy two servings of the minimum recommended for fruits and vegetables . Remember that juice counts too toward those recommended servings . Try this refreshing savory smoothie .'
cucumber	b'If you ca figure out how to cut down calorie consumption or if you having trouble getting all the fruits and vegetables you know your body needs the answer may be right in front of you . Look at what on your plate any time you see fruit or vegetables in tiny amounts or absent completely is an opportunity to trade some food on your plate for more fruits or vegetables . In the process you probably cut calories too . Simple trades in portions solve a lot of problems . For example although the serving size posted on a box of cereal is often one cup many people find that if they actually measure their usual portion it close to two cups or 180 to 200 calories more than they thought they consumed . If they would eat just one cup of cereal and filled the rest of the bowl with sliced fruit they be just as full . They would also have consumed about 100 fewer calories . And they would be starting the day with the fruit fiber and nutrients that are so important to good health . Pasta salad is another great place to make a switch . Most versions contain 90 percent pasta . A little chopped celery carrot or pepper is added for color and crunch but not enough to provide a serving worth of antioxidants and phytochemicals . Many people concerned about calorie content focus on the amount and type of salad dressing they use . But there is another major consideration . Each of pasta supplies about 100 calories but the same amount of chopped vegetables supplies only about 25 . By switching the proportions of salad ingredients so there are at least equal amounts of vegetables and pasta preferably more veggies you can cut at least 75 calories from each portion . You can use this technique even if you buy your salad at the deli . Start with the regular pasta salad and add an equal amount of chopped vegetables . Use the salad bar if you rushed . So much dressing is usually used on these salads that yours will likely still be moist with the added vegetables . But if needed use only a dash more dressing or light mayonnaise to reach the right consistency . Proportions can also get out of control with sandwiches and subs . To keep hunger at bay for several hours adequate protein is important . But a towering sandwich or sub with a mountain of meat and a single lettuce leaf and slice of tomato is out of proportion . Start with two to three ounces of turkey or other lean meat or a cheese or vegetarian filling . Then supersize it by piling on tomatoes cucumbers peppers zucchini and other veggies . The same principle applies to eating ice cream which sometimes is garnished with a dab of strawberry sauce . Turn that bowl of ice cream into a colorful fruit fiesta . Stick to a of ice cream preferably and fill the rest of the bowl with whatever fruit is in season . The calorie savings add up quickly and it a delicious way to feast on fruit . The idea is to have a little ice cream with your fruit not a little fruit with your ice cream . Each a portion of potatoes pasta rice or cereal has about 100 calories . Lean meat poultry and fish contain about the same amount but ground meat and or breaded choices are at least double that . On the other hand the same cup filled with most vegetables without added fat is only 25 calories and a similar portion of fruit without added sugar averages about 50 calories . Each trade to boost fruit or vegetables saves 50 to 75 calories . Yet you still eat the same total amount of food . And you a closer to the recommended five to ten servings of fruits and vegetables recommended by health experts .'

cucumber	b'Maybe you had this experience After arriving at a restaurant ravenously hungry you first eat a salad . Later when the main course arrives all you can do is nibble and pick at it . If this has happened to you you stumbled across a good weight management strategy . Research shows that starting with a large salad can help cut overall calorie consumption at a meal . But your approach to the meal as well as the salad size and composition make a difference . To prove that salads can cut calorie intake Pennsylvania State University researchers gave women large salads three cups total for lunch before serving them the rest of the meal . The women ate about 100 calories less at these meals compared to meals when no salad was served . The salads included lettuce grated carrots tomato celery and cucumber with limited amounts of dressing . The women needed to eat large salads to reduce calorie intake by 100 calories . Salads half that size which are more typical of American portions reduced total calories by only about half as much . The salads must be to help you manage your weight . When salads slightly higher in fat and calories were served in the Penn State study overall calorie consumption at the meal stayed the same . Worse yet large portions of salads with cheese and regular dressings actually increased overall calorie consumption at meals by 17 percent . But before you make large salads your primary weight loss strategy examine your eating style . In a survey commissioned by the American Institute for Cancer Research many people report that the amount they eat is not governed by hunger but by how much food is on the plate . Many people automatically clean their plate regardless of their appetite . If you are a plate cleaner beware of serving yourself the regular amounts of dishes following the salad . To reduce the total number of calories you eat at a meal you need to eat smaller portions of the remaining dishes . Your hunger should be satisfied with smaller portions . Furthermore wait a bit before serving yourself the rest of the meal after the salad . In the Penn State study the remaining food was served 20 minutes after the salad . That space gave the women time to recognize how much they had already eaten . If you eat quickly you might still eat the same amount after a large salad if your body lacks the time to sense its fullness . While eating large salads first may be a good strategy simply including more filling foods in your meal should help cut calories too . Small salads hearty portions of one or more vegetables even a broth or soup are worth a try as well as healthy . Along with your foods however be sure that your meal includes some source of protein whether it is meat poultry fish dairy or vegetarian . Otherwise within a few hours you be ready to eat again and your calorie savings may be wiped out . As you should see the success to a salad strategy for weight control depends upon proper food portions . By filling up primarily on foods like salads vegetables or light soups you can cut back on foods like meats and desserts . That one reason why you should switch to a diet that emphasizes vegetables fruits whole grains and beans . This style of eating is the New American Plate program that the American Institute for Cancer Research advocates for weight control and better health .'

cucumber	b'Laccases are a family of multicopper oxidases that bear a close resemblance particularly in amino acid sequence to ascorbate oxidase found in cucumbers and mammalian plasma protein ceruloplasmin . First isolated in 1883 from Rhus venicifera the Japanese lacquer tree laccases are also commonly found in fungi such as the lignolytic fungus Trametes versicolor . They have also recently been discovered in bacteria . Their physiological function is still under intense investigation although they are implicated in the synthesis degradation of the biopolymer lignin wound response mechanisms and the morphogenesis of microorganisms . They have a broad specificity that enables them to catalyse the one electron oxidation of a range of substrates . These substrates usually phenolic in nature provide electrons for the concomitant four electron reduction of atmospheric O2 to water . Catalysis takes place via the four copper centres which are classified according to their electronic properties . For example the type I T1 Cu shows a characteristic sulfur to Cu II charge transfer absorption band at 600 nm .'
cucumber	b'This specificity is both good and bad from an environmental point of view it good because the innocent are not slain with the guilty bugs . From an economic point of view it not so good .

Customers might not buy twelve varieties of biopesticide when one artificial compound can kill all twelve pests .'
cucumber	b'If baseline data are available problems are inevitable . Sitka had a painful lesson in that recently . The town was a center for a thriving new fishery in which divers collected sea cucumbers . Despite the name sea cucumbers are animals . These marine invertebrates do look something like oversized cucumbers but rather old and moldy ones . Though not popular for American menus probably because they look intrinsically inedible sea cucumbers are a delicacy in the Orient . They are not hard to catch they just lie on the bottom looking inedible and suitable waters in Southeastern harbor great numbers of them . Some three hundred people were involved in the new fishery until state authorities brought it to an abrupt close .'
cucumber	b'They had to . Naive communities had protested that this natural resource was being dangerously exploited maybe . No one could be sure . No one has any idea how much harvesting the population can stand there are no statistics on recruitment or population profiles nobody is certain even about the reproductive cycle of Alaska sea cucumbers . So no one knew if the fishery was based on animals five years or five decades old . Given that level of ignorance stringent regulation is the only prudent course .'
cucumber	b'The underemployed divers who spoke to the commission were not blaming anyone in particular for this lack of knowledge . They understood that gathering baseline data is not really the business of the university and that it certainly had been the business of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game . That agency has to hustle to keep up with the need for knowledge on the fisheries . And the divers had certainly heard politicians baying about cutting yet more stringently in every agency budget . If some foresighted researchers had proposed ten years back that a thorough study of sea cucumbers was economically necessary they have been met with laughter if not terminations notices . Yet ten years is pretty short for establishing a reliable baseline natural systems show a great deal of variability .'
cucumber	b'The next report in that issue of Science told of similar work on cucumbers . Most of the researchers on this team were Swiss but they were as willing to give plants a tough time as the New Jersey group was . They challenged cucumbers with a fungus and a virus and both turned on the response . That in turn apparently triggered the genes and the plants fended off the infections . They also developed what the scientists called systemic acquired resistance that is they had more resistance to new infections by the same organisms introduced at other sites on the plants .'

cucumber	b'While the determination of age has been primarily mediated visually the ambient odor may also have influence . To determine this subjects age average of 28 years ranging from 13 years to 71 years in a single blinded randomized fashion estimated the age of models in twenty photographs while wearing either blank masks or masks impregnated with a grape cucumber or grapefruit aroma . The grape odor p 0.198 and the cucumber odor p 0.244 had no effect . The grapefruit aroma reduced subjects perception of overall models ages by an average of approximately three years p 0.025 and of female models age by five years p 0.053 . Possible mechanisms whereby the grapefruit aroma created a rejuvenating effect with relationship to perceived age includes induction of positive affect expectancy effect sexual arousal anxiolysis change in cognitive set . The perceived rejuvenating effect of the grapefruit aroma may have utility in facilitating inter generational communication or act as an adjuvant in cosmetic and pharmaceutical usage to affect age perception like Botox with less associated risk .'

cucumber	b'The development of resistance to the B.t.t. proteins by insect pests that may then cause further problems in other crops is another consideration . Potato flea beetles Coleoptera Chrysomelidae Epitrix cucumeris Harris can cause significant damage to potatoes especially in the Maritimes yield reduction and can also visit cucumbers eggplants peppers and tomatoes . Tuber flea beetles Coleoptera Chrysomelidae Epitrix tuberis Gentner feed on potatoes and tomatoes . It is a very serious pest west of the Rockies and is also found in Alberta . Potato flea beetles E. cucumeris have been shown to be affected by the NewLeaftm potatoes but they can survive . This species and others in this genus may develop resistance to the B.t.t. insecticidal proteins . Presently B.t.t. foliar sprays are not registered for control of these beetles in Canada due to reduced efficacy so even should resistance occur control of these insects would not be compromised . CFIA has therefore concluded that development of resistance in insect pests is unlikely to have an impact on the conventional control of these pests .'
cucumber	b'The Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Regulations provide grades and standards for greenhouse and field cucumbers . By definition greenhouse cucumbers are cucumbers that have been grown in artificial conditions under glass or other protective covering . Field cucumbers are cucumbers that are not greenhouse cucumbers .'
cucumber	b'Sound means that at the time of packing loading or final shipping point inspection the cucumbers are free from decay breakdown freezing injury soft or shrivelled specimens over ripe specimens or other injury affecting the keeping quality . These requirements will be explained in more detail throughout this manual .'
cucumber	b'Cucumbers of the same general shape and color are considered as having similar varietal characteristics . This means that seedless cucumbers or English type cucumbers can not be mixed with regular seeded cucumbers .'
cucumber	b'By Regulations properly packed means that when the cucumbers are packed in a package they are not so packed as to be slack or overpressed or otherwise in a condition likely to result in damage during handling or while in transit .'
cucumber	b'well filled and slightly slack tight enough to prevent cucumbers from moving within the package sufficiently to cause injury under normal handling conditions there may be the proper amount of bulge but slight looseness in layers .'
cucumber	b'Otherwise if the shrink wrap is not transparent or markings are present all the requirements for labeling must be met . For greenhouse cucumbers there is a special tolerance for the number of cucumbers found in the package . If the package contains a different number of greenhouse cucumbers than marked on the package the package will be scored .'
cucumber	b'The marketing of domestic cucumbers interprovincially that have been shrink wrapped with color enhanced shrink wrap is not permitted to have a grade name marked on it as the true nature and quality of the cucumbers can not be readily discerned .'
cucumber	b'Cucumbers are harvested when horticulturally mature i.e. when they are firm of a good characteristic color and of a size dictated by the Regulations . At this stage cucumbers have reached their prime eating quality although still botanically immature . Therefore the firmness the color and the size are the most important quality factors affecting the market value of cucumbers .'
cucumber	b'The good characteristic green color of cucumbers is to be assessed from the standpoint of the variety . For example some field varieties are characterized by the presence of white spines especially at the blossom end . Burpee greenhouse cucumbers possess a medium green color which at times during the season is accompanied by slight greying or white speckling effect over the sides .'
cucumber	b'In contrast the Mark II greenhouse cucumber is noted for its dark green color . These varietal characteristics must not be scored as defects or taken into consideration in the determination of the good characteristic color .'
cucumber	b'Cucumbers may have uncharacteristic color as the result of permanent factors such as ground spots and leaf shading or as a result of condition factors such as holding cucumbers at temperatures higher than 15oC or storing transporting cucumbers with fruit that produces high levels of ethylene gas .'
cucumber	b'For example a Canada No. 1 cucumber with a 10 ground spot permanent defect and an area of greenish yellow condition defects of 6 will be scored as failing to meet the characteristic color requirement under condition defect .'
cucumber	b'Yellowing may also be associated with overmaturity . Overmature field cucumbers and non seedless greenhouse cucumbers are characterized by seeds that are large tough and fibrous . The pulp in the seed cavity is usually watery and jelly like . In the more advanced stage pithy streaks may be found in the flesh . Affected cucumbers turn yellow yield to slight pressure of the thumb and are unpalatable .'
cucumber	b'Firmness and freshness are associated with water loss . If cucumbers are still green water loss may occur during prolonged holding at or below recommended temperatures . However to prevent water loss seedless greenhouse cucumbers which have a thin skin are shrink wrapped . Sometimes for long distance shipping field cucumbers may be waxed . If they are yellowish and or have lost moisture during a brief period this indicates poor handling storage practices or slow stock turnover . Field and greenhouse cucumbers that yield to a moderate pressure at one or both ends of the cucumbers are noticeably shrivelled will be scored against all grades .'
cucumber	b'Although there are a number of insects which cause damage to the cucumber plant only a few appear to affect the cucumber itself . The most common are the Striped Cucumber Beetle the Melon Caterpillar and the Pickle Worm . The adult Cucumber Beetles sometimes feed on the cucumber and when this injury is extensive the cucumber becomes badly scarred deformed and lumpy or warty in appearance . Both the Melon Caterpillar and the Pickle Worm bore into the cucumber . This type of injury is serious because it frequently permits fungal organisms to gain entry and cause decay .'
cucumber	b'Cucumbers are susceptible to high and low temperature injury . Chilling damage will occur in cucumbers that are stored at 10oC therefore cucumbers must be stored at temperatures between 10oC and 15oC with the optimum temperature between 12oC and 13oC .'
cucumber	b'Sometimes when a wholesaler receives a load of cucumbers at a temperature below the chilling point no symptoms are present on the cucumbers . However a day later pitting droplets and decay can start to appear . If this is the case the inspector should do an inspection report on the temperature and the damage as they see it . Then they must advise the consignee that the load of cucumbers may have been subject to low temperatures and the condition of the cucumber may change at a later date .'
cucumber	b'This model is to be applied to fermented pickled products that are acidified through natural fermentation . It is recognized that formulations and processes may vary with product and plant .

Pickles are fermentation products from fresh cucumbers and natural mixed starter lactic acid flora of cucumbers . Natural fermentation may take from six to nine weeks to fully achieve a finished product . However fermentation of lactic acid required to reduce the pH to acidify the cucumbers to 4.0 or below must be achieved rapidly within 48 hours .'

Harvard Ave. Upon entering Jim fine establishment you realize immediately what a mom and pop operation this restaurant is .

The walls sport some ultra tacky paintings that depict one assumes the old days in Athens . The menu offers only a few choices making it quick and easy to decide what to eat . There are pretty much three choices some sort of hot dog souvlaki or yero . The hot dogs are the standard Coney Island dogs . They look pretty good if you like that sort of thing . Souvlaki translates to meat on a skewer . In this case deliciously tender pork grilled to perfection and sprinkled with red pepper seasoning . The souvlaki can be ordered with pita bread or rice . Ordering the souvlaki plate gets you canned green beans house salad a bed of rice and the skewer of meat . Yero in all likelihood spelled this way to prevent Tulsans from embarrassing mispronunciation is sliced mystery meat with sauce . The yero was as tender as the souvlaki but rather than being grilled it was sliced off a rotisserie . It was also available with pita bread rice or as a platter . Overall Jim food is pretty good . Do forget to stop by an ATM on your way there they do take American Express Visa or checks . Jim is open Monday through Saturday 11 a.m. to p.m.'

mushroom	b'Polk says that Southeast Asian cooks distinguish between a wide range of individual flavors hot sour salty sweet bitter pungent astringent and umami a flavor component sometimes described as depth or mouth feel . And Polk notes because smell is involved in the perception of flavor a richer combination of flavors produces a richer aroma . For example instead of simply relying on ordinary salt for a bit of saltiness Polk observes Asian cooks often use fermented fish or soybean products that in addition to a salty flavor also add some pungency and depth as well as umami . Onion radish ginger garlic mustard anchovies and various herbs also provide a pleasant pungency to prepared foods . The slightly bitter component of a dish says Polk derives from dark leafy greens like kale spinach mustard greens and many herbs as well as vinegar and some citrus juices . Umami flavoring according to Polk is the taste Westerners associate with broth and Parmesan cheese . In Asia umami is associated with broth as well as dried mushrooms soybean paste miso and fish sauce .'

mushroom	b'A You can use these foods to make a balanced meal . The basic idea of balanced meals like those recommended by the American Institute for Cancer Research is to include protein starchy complex carbohydrates and fruits vegetables in every meal . The largest parts of the meal should be the grains fruits and vegetables . In pizza whole wheat crust is now increasingly available for a healthful source of complex carbohydrate grain and cheese supplies the protein . Vegetable toppings like peppers onions mushrooms tomatoes and spinach provide good nutrition and taste . Realistically though you have to eat a lot of pizza to get a substantial serving of vegetables . Try serving the pizza with salad or raw vegetables on the side or offer fruit for dessert . If you do overdo the amount of pizza available people will be more likely to add in these other choices . Burritos also make it easy to get the grain tortilla and protein beans cheese a little chicken or meat if you want . The problem once again is that it hard to load enough lettuce tomatoes and other veggies into just one or two burritos . So cut back on the meat chicken and cheese to make room for fresh vegetables and enjoy some fruit for dessert .'
mushroom	b'Because I live in New York City I love escaping to the country or the shore at any time of year . Walking on a snowy beach is as much a treat as basking on a one . If it is too cold to stay out for long gazing at the landscape while sitting indoors by a crackling fire is great too . Mostly I am blessed to be a enjoying the fresh air and quiet without the responsibilities of owning or even renting a weekend place . But being a has downsides too . One is having little control over what you get to eat . My friends typically prepare excellent food since most of them are food lovers . But I have had to develop a clever ploy to make sure that every day I can get a good amount of vegetables some whole grains and enough fiber . My secret is a repertoire of soups . Most people are happy when a guest prepares one dish for a meal and what host can complain if you want to use just one pot and hang out in the kitchen for an hour or less I accompany them to their supermarket which is enjoyable since it is almost always more enticing than the overcrowded versions in the city . I grab a few packages of veggies like diced butternut squash broccoli florets and sliced mushrooms and a package or two of fresh herbs . The dried ones found in most kitchens have lost their flavor and fresh herbs are so packed with phytonutrients that they are worth the cost . I also buy a can of beans and a loaf of crusty bread . Back in the kitchen I can make my soup in less time than most hosts spend fixing burgers on the grill and adding their embellishments . To be a model guest I sometimes offer to make a salad and shoo them out of the kitchen entirely . Or we simply pick up a healthful pizza at the best joint in town knowing that with my soup accompanying it we will eat well in every sense . By adding this soup to a dinner you can also eat healthy especially if you buy squash that has already been peeled and diced .'

mushroom	b'Our best chance to control colon cancer is to prevent or detect and remove a certain type of polyp before it becomes malignant . Colorectal polyps are extra bits of tissue generally shaped like a mushroom or a small dome growing inside the colon large intestine or rectum . These polyps are common . An estimated 30 to 40 percent of adults over the age of 50 develop them . Most are noncancerous and will never develop into cancer . However one type known as adenomatous polyps or adenomas can become cancerous . About 95 percent of colon cancers develop from these benign polyps . Yet they are easily removed . However less than half of people 50 and older follow national guidelines for colorectal screenings according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . When to Start ScreeningRectal bleeding or blood in the stool which can make the stool black or streaked with red can indicate the presence of a polyp . However most polyps produce no symptoms at all . They are found only with a routine screening test or a procedure conducted for other reasons that look into the colon . Some researchers say that it takes at least five years for a benign polyp to become cancerous so frequent screenings are unnecessary . Health experts recommend that you begin having colorectal screening tests at age 50 or sooner if you or a family member has a history of polyps or colon cancer . Your physician can create a screening schedule appropriate for you based on your individual level of risk . Prevention is the Better CourseInstead of detecting and removing polyps it would be better to prevent them . Smoking excessive alcohol consumption a sedentary lifestyle and overweight all appear to increase polyp formation . If you are overweight or practice one of these risky behaviors gradually try to change your habits to live more healthfully . To lower your colon cancer risk more you should eat a lowfat mostly diet . This kind of diet that is full of various vegetables fruits whole grains and beans is commonly associated with a lower risk of colon cancer . Eating a diet like this might inhibit colon cancer in several ways such as decreasing polyp formation slowing the growth of polyps or blocking their transition from benign to cancerous . For the best protection you should limit red meat consumption and meet the current recommendations for folate . Folate is found in dark green leafy vegetables orange juice and other plant foods and it often low in American diets . Calcium and vitamin D are also important . Most adults can meet current recommendations for calcium and vitamin D by having three cups of nonfat or lowfat milk a day . If you over age 50 or do drink much milk consider other fortified foods or supplements .'

mushroom	b'Research suggests that diet can affect a man risk of prostate cancer . Mounting evidence indicates that certain foods may aid in preventing this cancer if they are part of a mostly diet . Overall scientists believe that cancer risk can be lowered percent by eating a diet that contains mainly foods like vegetables fruits whole grains and beans along with getting regular exercise and maintaining a healthy weight . Studies show these healthy habits can also help prevent prostate cancer . Now researchers are beginning to get a clearer picture of how particular foods may lower prostate cancer risk . Among them are tomatoes and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli . Other foods that may fight prostate cancer include soy garlic green tea and flaxseed . Minerals such as zinc and selenium as well as vitamin E are also under investigation . A Menu for PreventionCruciferous vegetables With funding from AICR researchers are investigating how the compound I3C may inhibit the growth of prostate cancer cells in cultures and help to eliminate tumor cells in the body . A new study will compare the effects of consuming cruciferous vegetables to taking I3C supplements on lowering PSA antigen levels in patients that have had prostate surgery . Researchers are also looking at whether isothiocyanates found in cruciferous vegetables can help prevent prostate cancer . Scientists also have found evidence that eating foods together like tomatoes with broccoli may maximize the effect of these foods . Selenium Selenium is found in fish poultry eggs grains mushrooms and other foods . With a grant from AICR Arthur Sytkowski M.D. of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston has been investigating how selenium may suppress prostate cancer . In laboratory and animal studies on prostate cancer cells when the gene for this protein which scientists call hSP56 was turned on prostate cancer slowed . But when the gene was turned off the cancer grew and spread more rapidly says Dr. Sytkowski . Selenium binds to the protein and appears to regulate its action which may help explain selenium role in cancer prevention . To find out whether selenium and vitamin E supplements can lower prostate cancer risk more than men have enrolled in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial . Results are expected in 2013 . Soy Laboratory and animal studies show that genistein a phytochemical in soybeans may inhibit prostate cancer cell growth and tumor development . In an study of early stage prostate cancer patients Nagi Kumar Ph.D. of the University of South Florida found that PSA levels in the blood and other indicators of prostate cancer risk were moderately reduced in patients taking an supplement compared to those not taking the supplement . The PSA test is controversial however it may be a valuable screening when repeated with the same patient . Although trials are needed it is reasonable for men concerned about their prostate health to incorporate soy foods into their diets times per week says Dr. Kumar . With funding from AICR Gilda Hillman Ph.D. of the Karmanos Cancer Institute at Wayne State University in Michigan has been studying how soy may potentially increase the effect of radiation therapy for prostate cancer . In cell cultures genistein increased the destruction of prostate tumor cells when given with radiation says Dr. Hillman . We also found that prolonged feeding of genistein to mice combined with tumor irradiation caused a significant reduction of cancer growth in the prostate and controlled the spread of cancer to the lymph nodes . On the horizon Garlic green tea flaxseed and zinc are also being investigated through research . For example in laboratory and animal studies EGCG a polyphenol in green tea stopped the development and growth of prostate cancer cells . A new clinical study of prostate cancer patients will examine to what degree drinking green tea can lower PSA levels and kill cancer cells . The effects of a diet on prostate cell growth and PSA levels are also being studied . Flaxseed is rich in lignans a type of fiber and in fatty acids which may slow tumor growth .'

However one type known as adenomatous polyps or adenomas can become cancerous . Genetic changes in these polyps lead to changes in the growth and regulation of their cells causing them to multiply abnormally . Most adenomas do become cancerous but experts say removing them is an excellent way to make sure they do . Rectal bleeding or blood in the stool which can make the stool black or streaked with red can indicate the presence of a polyp . However most polyps produce no symptoms at all . They are found only with a routine screening test or a procedure conducted for other reasons that looks into the colon .

Your physician can create a screening schedule appropriate for you based on your individual level of risk . Of course instead of detecting and removing polyps it would be better to prevent them altogether . Research suggests that smoking excessive alcohol consumption a sedentary lifestyle and overweight all increase polyp formation . Many studies have been done to see how a person eating habits might promote or block the formation of polyps but specific answers are still lacking . A diet with plenty of vegetables fruits whole grains and beans is commonly associated with a lower risk of colon cancer . Yet in one recent large population study fiber consumption was unconnected to colon cancer occurrence . No randomized clinical trial the most convincing type of human study has shown that increasing people dietary fiber decreases the first appearance or recurrence of polyps either . The problem with the randomized clinical trials so far may be their short duration . None has been more than four years long . It is probable that diet affect on colon cancer takes place over a longer period of time . Despite the lack of supporting evidence from randomized clinical trials you should still eat the lowfat mostly diet researchers recommend to lower colon cancer risk . This eating style might inhibit colon cancer in several ways such as decreasing polyp formation slowing the growth of polyps or blocking their transition from benign to cancerous . Other steps you could take to decrease the formation of colon polyps include limiting your red meat consumption and meeting the current recommendations for folate . This nutrient is found in dark green leafy vegetables orange juice and other plant foods and it often low in Americans diets . You should also get enough calcium and vitamin D. Unfortunately the definition of what constitutes enough calcium and vitamin D is still in flux but it appears that Americans should get more of both . Most adults can meet current recommendations for calcium and vitamin D by having three cups of nonfat or lowfat milk a day . If you over age 50 or do drink much milk consider other fortified foods or supplements .'

mushroom	b'According to Eef Arnolds a fungal ecologist at the Agricultural University of the Netherlands woodland fungus species are in a catastrophic decline throughout Europe . If that were true only for prized edible mushrooms like chanterelles or boletus it would be easy to assume that they had fallen victim to overharvesting . Yet even toadstools inedible or downright poisonous species are more scarce than they have ever been . Arnolds asserts that changing forest management practices are not to blame because fungal quantities and varieties have declined in all types of mature forest no matter how the trees have been tended .'
mushroom	b'Arnolds colleagues agree with his findings . One mycologist Johannes Schmitt of the University of Saarbrucken in Germany has been weighing the wild mushroom crop sold in the local market every year since 1950 . Both total numbers and individual sizes of the chanterelle and boletus mushrooms offered in the market have shrunk spectacularly . In 1975 it took 50 times as many local chanterelles to make up a kilogram as it did in 1958 .'

mushroom	b'In most plants sunlight reacts with chlorophyll to produce its food starch through photosynthesis during which oxygen is manufactured as well . The mushroom could care less about sunlight because it has no chlorophyll in it at all . Instead fungi such as mushrooms feed on rotted vegetation and other organic material such as manure and chemically treated straw in the case of the commercially grown product . In the wild they must subsist on less exotic fare such as dead litter and roots on the forest floor .'
mushroom	b'Because they can not manufacture their food in place as leaves do they continually spread outward from the site of their original planting or spawning consuming decomposing vegetable matter as they go . Actually threadlike filaments called mycelia are the spreading vegetative portion of the fungus growing entirely underground and the mushrooms are the fruiting bodies .'
mushroom	b'While green plants supply the bulk of oxygen to our atmosphere forest fungi such as mushrooms nurture our soil by leaving behind a residue of decomposed organic remains enriched in nitrogen and phosphorous .'

mushroom	b'Hundreds of thousands of different fungi exist . We are familiar with those that form blue and green molds on oranges cheeses and lemons and the white gray or black furry outgrowths on bread meat or jam left in damp places .

Fungi are the principal agents in the fermentation of wine and beer ripening of cheeses the production of antibiotics like penicillin and industrial production of vitamins and citric acid .'
mushroom	b'No less fascinating is the explanation that mushroom mycelium creates fairy rings on our lawns . Mycelium is the term for the underground mass of interwoven threadlike filaments that are a part of mushrooms and other fungi . Mycelium spreads through the soil decomposing dead grass roots and other organic material as it extends outward in circular fashion . Like fire in dry leaves mycelium consumes what it can use in the center and it must grow radially to acquire new fuel . Mushrooms the fruiting bodies of mycelium are formed at the outside edge of the actively spreading mycelium . The intense green color of the fairy ring is created by fresh fertilizer produced as humus is broken down into nutrients usable by the grass .'

mushroom	b'Some evidence of this is available in Wasson work where he identifies soma with a hallucinogenic mushroom which was consumed in northern Siberia and in Altic regions . That would bring it nearer to the origin of the Harappan civilization .'
mushroom	b'According to me this is one of my central discoveries but it has nothing to do with the script . But it may have indirect effect on the script . I have already pointed out a number of signs of the script which seem to show the mortar which is part of the soma ritual the filter itself is part of the script where you are shown a vessel with streams of water or droplets falling below and therefore it is also not unlikely and you should expect it in fact that such an important ritual would be mentioned in the seal inscriptions . Not only the seals but many of the sealings in Harappa for example the cylindrical terra cotta seal which Kenoyer has recently discovered . It shows the soma filter or filter on one side and a plant on the other side now that may be the plant the crushing of which gets you the soma juice . But we still do not know . While I have earlier accepted Wasson identification of soma as possibly a mushroom perhaps the last word has not been said on it . Most scholars identify soma with some form of ephedra . That again is a matter of some dispute . But whatever the origin of soma there is hardly any doubt that it was a kind of hallucinogenic drug which produced mild sensations of pleasure .'

mushroom	b'Ice caused aircraft to crash by adding weight and preventing the pilot from climbing above the icing clouds so that the aircraft gradually lost altitude and slammed into the ground . That was how most people understood the danger of icing . Rodert and Jones started their studies by showing that icing seldom enveloped the aircraft with weight but rather icing incapacitated small but crucial parts . As McAvoy had proved with his photos of ice projections and as Rodert and Jones confirmed ice accreted along the wing and tail leading edges disturbing lift and adding drag . Ice clogged the interstices of rudders and ailerons preventing control and inducing buffeting .

banana	b'Avoid dairy products if they increase indigestion and diarrhea . Many liquid nutritional supplements are milk free and are available in a variety of flavors . Eat small amounts of food and liquids throughout the day . Drink plenty of liquids such as water diluted cranberry juice broth decaffeinated coffee or tea . Drinking fluids is important because your body may not get enough water when you have diarrhea . Drink liquids that are at room temperature . Avoid very hot or very cold foods . Eat plenty of foods and liquids that contain sodium and potassium . These minerals are often lost during diarrhea .

banana	b'A Just like cereal the kind of waffles you choose determines their nutrition qualities . Some frozen waffles are made only with refined flour whereas those with at least some flour provide more fiber and nutrients . For people who have trouble meeting their calcium needs with dairy products or other enriched foods there are even some frozen waffles that supply 30 percent of the Daily Value DV for calcium . A glass of milk contains the same amount of calcium . You should always check the fat content of waffles too when choosing . The ultimate nutritional value of waffles however depends on how you serve them . If you spread a waffle with peanut butter and place apple or pear slices or raisins on top you have a healthy portable treat that will satisfy your hunger much longer than a waffle topped with butter or margarine and syrup . Waffles spread with vanilla yogurt and a variety of fruits like kiwi banana and fresh or frozen berries are also excellent breakfasts or snacks .'

banana	b'Q What kind of nutritious snacks that do need refrigeration could I keep in my desk A Since most of us have trouble meeting the goal of five to ten servings of fruits and vegetables each day adding a fruit snack would be a great choice . Each day you can snack on a piece of fruit or a container of grapes or chopped fruit . Some fruits like oranges and bananas can be kept in a desk or locker for several days . For longer storage look for small packages of fruit and unsweetened applesauce . Raisins and other dried fruit will also last for long periods of time just pay attention to your portion size since their concentrated calories add up quickly . Nuts are another food that demands portion control but they provide great fiber and nutrients . The protein in nuts will also help hold off hunger longer than many other snacks . Another snack idea is to pack small containers with a mixture of cereals or crackers .'

On the contrary Mahadevan suggests that the Harappan script may represent a proto Dravidian language and the script was probably read from right to left . Mahadevan believes that the relationship of the terminal sign to the other signs is probably semantic rather than grammatical . He argues that the Harappan seals probably give the names and titles of users . The Indus names and titles might have passed on into later Indic languages as loan words . The shapes of the Harappan ideograms should have kept significance for later South Asian people . Through comparison with later Indic languages and symbolism the meaning of some of these signs can be retrieved . Mahadevan is looking for correlates with later Indian languages . In searching for ideographic parallels he has determined that the terminal sign on a seal such as the one being discussed here indicates the class of person to which the name is attached . The terminal sign on the seals in Harappan script probably work as an ideogram . Figure 17.3 shows five of the most common terminal signs on Harappan seals . The terminal sign on this seal is a combination of the first and third symbols . In Indic culture the jar represents the priest and Mahadevan argues that this third sign represents a bearer of office . Therefore he translates the terminal sign on this seal as indicating an officer or profunctory with priestly duties . Until a text is found with a known language to compare to the Harappan writing it will be impossible to refute or support such interpretations . Unfortunately the climate of the northwestern subcontinent is not conducive to the preservation of organic materials such as cured banana leaves upon which such a text might be preserved .'
banana	b'A banana is a solid right Well actually no. . Most of what inside a banana like all plants is water . When you cool down the banana all the molecules start to scrunch up and huddle together just like you and your friends do when you are cold . That means that the molecules are a little closer together and they are holding onto each other much more tightly . Because they holding on more tightly they do want to move as much and so the banana becomes hard as it freezes .'

Anyway around that time my interest in spaceflight had to step back a bit in favor of other things so I did note down the URL which was why it took quite some until I encountered it once more again by accident but this time it looked much more complete than the first time I saw it . Not surprisingly I could stop reading it . What a terrific resource . I felt like having to somehow pay for the possibility of reading it freely so I contacted Eric offering my help regarding some minor flaws I had found which he gladly and thankfully accepted . That how I got into it . Typing this text I realize that this again is already years ago . Well time flies like the wind fruit flies like bananas'

banana	b'Some of the more promising applications of ionizing radiation to the treatment of food are shown in table 1 . At the highest irradiation doses all food spoilage organisms and pathogens transmitted by food are killed prepackaged meats poultry and seafood can keep for years without refrigeration and on the plate of the consumer will still have a degree of acceptance approximating that of fresh food freshly cooked . At the lowest irradiation doses certain physiological functions associated with sprouting in tubers such as white potatoes and in bulbs such as onions will be disrupted these foods will not spoil during storage for as long as 1 year because of sprouting . Exposure of fruits such as tomatoes bananas mangoes and papayas to intermediate doses of ionizing radiation will slow down ripening and give these foods an extended shelf life ranging from a few days to several weeks . One application not included in table I is the use of irradiation to shorten rehydration and cooking time of dehydrated vegetables . For example with diced potatoes an irradiation dose of 8 megarads can shorten cooking time from approximately 20 minutes to less than 4 minutes .'

pizza	b'Since human nature is in large part defined by our wide array of emotional capabilities inclusive of those such as anger happiness frustration and sadness it should be easy to see that when individuals do not allow themselves to experience or overtly express their emotions their minds necessarily find other ways . In the case of most people with anorexia or bulimia one way they express themselves is in a loss of or attempted loss of weight through various means . While the loss of weight may become what the individual sees as their goal the numbers themselves are only a part of the expression . However it would not be equitable to abandon this comment without adding the reminder that there are always exceptions and variations to symptoms particularly in illnesses of the mind . For instance there are eating disorder patients who do not report the highly publicized distorted body image but experience symptomatically only an aversion to eating food . While being a slightly different presentation of symptoms they still have an eating disorder of concern not only because of obvious physical problems but also because of the emotional problems consistently present at the root of these illnesses . The losing weight aspect of an eating disorder to the person him or herself is part of a process that they may be unable to recognize as being abnormal . However while the anorexic is much more likely to be unsuspecting of their problem the bulimic person is more likely to have an awareness meanwhile experiencing both a loss of ability will to stop .

Food the abstinence from food maintain their waking and sleeping . Specifically the mind of the anorexic becomes like a calculator constantly clicking away figuring and refiguring their allotment and consumption of calories even while holding conversation . It is common for anorexics to wake up terrified during the night having had a dream that they ate something they consider taboo such as a regular soda or slice of pizza .'

pizza	b'Adding more vegetables fruits whole grains and beans to your diet can help bolster your overall health and reduce cancer risk . To help your body adjust to a mostly diet that is high in fiber starting slowly is key . People who are eager to reap the health benefits of a diet may try to do too much too soon . Similar to exercise it wise to begin slowly when incorporating plenty of fruits vegetables and whole grains into your diet for protection against cancer . In my gastroenterology practice I often see patients consuming fiber to excess says Antoinette Saddler M.D. Assistant Professor of Internal Medicine at the University of Virginia Health System Digestive Health Center of Excellence in Charlottesville . They ingest a huge amount of fiber eating multiple bran muffins for breakfast lots of broccoli and so on . You have to increase your fiber intake gradually so that your body can adjust . Gradually adopting a mostly diet will allow you to enjoy the many health benefits while preventing possible side effects . Weeding Out ProblemsAlthough a diet can help prevent many health problems it can cause some discomfort if not adopted gradually . Gas is one of the most common types of distress . When you eating foods they pass into the colon where bacteria digest them . This process produces gas says Dr. Saddler . People should introduce fiber slowly chew their food well minimize air swallowed and minimize how many carbonated beverages they consume . Enzyme supplements can help reduce intestinal gas that comes from foods . One very nutritious food that many people avoid for fear of developing intestinal gas is cooked dried beans . Unfortunately they are missing out on a delicious lowfat source of protein that also contains folate and fiber along with important minerals like potassium magnesium and iron . According to Registered Dietitian Karen Collins gas forms in some people because their digestive enzymes do not break down certain complex carbohydrates in these foods . Therefore the foods ferment excessively in the large intestine and emit gas . She suggests that people who develop gas after eating cooked dried beans and peas should look for supplements that contain the enzyme . You need to consume the supplements just before or at the same time you eat the food says Collins . They ca be added to the food while it cooks . You also can lessen the gas produced by canned beans by rinsing them well . For dried beans soak them several hours or overnight . Discard the water they soaked in before cooking them . Plant Foods and Digestive IllnessesSome people associate consumption of certain vegetables with heartburn as well as intestinal gas . But other factors are often more to blame . A meal swallowing larger chunks especially of meats and some common foods like orange juice can lead to heartburn in some people says Dr. Elaine Feldman of the Medical College of Georgia . Caffeine mints garlic alcohol and chocolate can cause heartburn and gastric distress too as can lifestylefactors such as smoking stress rushing through meals or lying down too soon after eating . Sometimes acidic vegetables and fruits such as citrus fruits and tomatoes may contribute to heartburn . Feldman suggests cooking tomatoes onions and garlic to help offset any discomfort these healthful plant foods may cause . When you cook fruits and vegetables to ease digestion use lowfat cooking methods bake broil steam or poach and choose healthy fats olive oil canola oil or another monounsaturated oil . Drink plenty of liquids including hot tea and broth . Last but not least exercise daily to help move waste through the system and prevent cancer . As for conditions such as diverticulitis and ulcers Dr. Saddler says People frequently confuse diverticulitis actual infection with diverticulosis a condition of pockets in the bowel she explains . Doctors may tell patients with diverticulosis to avoid small seeded items but I have not seen definitive data that proves this prevents the condition . People with diverticulosis should eat a diet to reduce developing pouches . She notes that a diet should have little or no impact on ulcers . People have heard through the years that spicy foods and acidic foods will cause ulcers but this is a myth Dr. Saddler explains . They should worry more about the aspirin and ibuprofen they take rather than the pizza they ate . Most ulcers are caused by an infection of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori . foods also can relieve constipation . One of the great things about a diet is that it helps with bowel movements Dr. Saddler says . There is a lot of constipation among older people because their colon motility slows down . They may have diseases or take drugs that cause constipation she says . It is important to increase water when you increase fiber to help with constipation . Older people should drink fluids before they become thirsty because the sense of thirst decreases with aging .'
pizza	b'A They do need to be . Roasting is a terrific way to prepare many vegetables because it intensifies flavors and brings out a natural sweetness . To roast vegetables cut them into chunks place them in a thin layer on a large baking tray and drizzle them very lightly with olive oil or lightly coat with a cooking oil spray . Bake them at 400 or 425 degrees for 30 to 40 minutes until they are lightly browned and tender but not mushy . Baking time will vary with the vegetables you use . Almost any vegetable roasts well except tender greens or delicate snap peas . You can serve roasted vegetables straight from the oven as a side dish or let them cool to room temperature before splashing them with balsamic vinegar to make a roasted vegetable salad . Zucchini bell peppers Portobello mushroom and onions make a great roasted combo . You can also turn them into a vegetarian main dish by adding some toasted nuts and a little Parmesan cheese and serving it with bread . Roasted vegetables are also great as pizza toppings or pita fillings or served sliced over whole wheat pasta or brown rice .'
pizza	b'Wholesome Whole GrainsBefore you start making the central dish of your lunch usually the traditional sandwich consider its main ingredient . Since about 60 percent of a sandwich is bread find bread made of flour . Some breads are dark brown but there may not be many or any whole grains in them . Caramel color or molasses is often added to give a deep color . Whole grains which are much more than refined white flour are full of fiber and filling . They are rich in many substances like antioxidants phytochemicals vitamin E folic acid zinc selenium and magnesium . When selecting a loaf of bread the ingredient label should list as the first item either 100 percent whole grain or the word whole followed by the grain used . Try purchasing different kinds of breads if a particular one does appeal to you . breads with oats on the outside tend to be slighter sweeter . For a wonderfully soft and chewy taste bake your own with flour or look for freshly baked loaves . tortillas and pita bread are also great alternatives that you may prefer .

pizza	b'A You can use these foods to make a balanced meal . The basic idea of balanced meals like those recommended by the American Institute for Cancer Research is to include protein starchy complex carbohydrates and fruits vegetables in every meal . The largest parts of the meal should be the grains fruits and vegetables . In pizza whole wheat crust is now increasingly available for a healthful source of complex carbohydrate grain and cheese supplies the protein . Vegetable toppings like peppers onions mushrooms tomatoes and spinach provide good nutrition and taste . Realistically though you have to eat a lot of pizza to get a substantial serving of vegetables . Try serving the pizza with salad or raw vegetables on the side or offer fruit for dessert . If you do overdo the amount of pizza available people will be more likely to add in these other choices . Burritos also make it easy to get the grain tortilla and protein beans cheese a little chicken or meat if you want . The problem once again is that it hard to load enough lettuce tomatoes and other veggies into just one or two burritos . So cut back on the meat chicken and cheese to make room for fresh vegetables and enjoy some fruit for dessert .'

Most people are happy when a guest prepares one dish for a meal and what host can complain if you want to use just one pot and hang out in the kitchen for an hour or less I accompany them to their supermarket which is enjoyable since it is almost always more enticing than the overcrowded versions in the city . I grab a few packages of veggies like diced butternut squash broccoli florets and sliced mushrooms and a package or two of fresh herbs . The dried ones found in most kitchens have lost their flavor and fresh herbs are so packed with phytonutrients that they are worth the cost . I also buy a can of beans and a loaf of crusty bread . Back in the kitchen I can make my soup in less time than most hosts spend fixing burgers on the grill and adding their embellishments . To be a model guest I sometimes offer to make a salad and shoo them out of the kitchen entirely . Or we simply pick up a healthful pizza at the best joint in town knowing that with my soup accompanying it we will eat well in every sense . By adding this soup to a dinner you can also eat healthy especially if you buy squash that has already been peeled and diced .'

pizza	b'Country musicians be they alternative traditional or never tire of singing praises to the Carter Family . Heck even the occasional rocker will say a few kind words about the Carter legacy . With this type of enthusiasm there never a bad time to put together a tribute album like The Unbroken Circle . The album is packed with VIPs like Emmylou Harris George Jones Sheryl Crow and Willie Nelson and it even includes no less than three Cashes Johnny June Carter and Rosanne . Despite this impressive list The Unbroken Circle gets a very rocky start with lukewarm efforts by Jones Crow Harris and Johnny Cash . Jones and Cash sound fairly rough and Harris outing backed by the Peasall Sisters is underwhelming . Crow appearance on a country record is somewhat surprising and perhaps it was meant to add a little pizzazz to the disc .

pizza	b'John Leonora PhD teacher and researcher in physiology at Loma Linda University School of Medicine passed away February 17 2006 . He graduated from University of Wisconsin in 1957 and then pursued a postdoctoral fellowship with the National Institutes of Health . In 1959 he joined the faculty in the endocrinology research group department of medicine College of Medical Evangelists on the Los Angeles campus . Shortly thereafter he transferred to Loma Linda when CME was consolidated on the Loma Linda campus becoming Loma Linda University . Much of his research was conducted in collaboration with Dr. Ralph Steinman LLU School of Dentistry . Using animal models they were able to show that removal of the parotid glands resulted in rampant dental caries . They described the movement of fluid from the internal pulp of the teeth outward through the dentin and enamel to the tooth surface . This action disappeared with parotidectomy . They later showed that a high sucrose diet also interrupted this fluid movement and resulted in dental caries . The dentinal fluid transport concept was so novel that it encountered opposition and rejection by both the dental and medical professions . Nevertheless Dr. Leonora and his colleagues pursued their research . They were able to isolate the parotid hormone characterize it chemically synthesize it and eventually clone the gene that codes for the parotid hormone . Other researchers overseas have since confirmed these profound advances . For more than four decades Dr. Leonora delighted in teaching . His lectures were remembered by his students for their clarity and quiet humor . In recognition of his devoted service Dr. Leonora received the Graduate School Distinguished Service Award in 2001 honorary membership in Omicron Kappa Upsilon OKU dental honor society in 2004 and the School of Medicine Distinguished Service Award in 2005 . This year Dentinal Fluid Transport was published . The book authored by Dr. Clyde Roggenkamp is about the life research of Ralph Steinman and John Leonora . He was profoundly dedicated to his family his wife Johanna daughters Carmela and Andrea and three lovely grandchildren . In his leisure time he delighted in the quietude of his country home . He spent hours working in the yard and cooking in the kitchen . He was justifiably famous for his homemade pizza pasta sauce and biscotti . Dr. Leonora life and contributions will not be forgotten . On April 17 2006 a Lectureship was officially started by LLUSD with in contributions . Interest from this continuing endowment will help cover honoraria for lecturers to speak on subjects relating to dental biology in the research areas of Ralph Steinman and John Leonora .

bucket	b'Mike Stewart has been training gun dogs for more than 30 years . He has spent the last 14 in northern Mississippi at Wildrose Kennels near Oxford . Listed among his current pupils is a handsome black Lab puppy named Drake who just happens to be Ducks Unlimited canine mascot . The pride of DU is at this juncture a work in progress . A disciple of trainer Robert Milner who established Wildrose Kennels in 1972 near Grand Junction Tennessee Stewart continues to strive to promote calm cooperative gun dogs . Drake is but one of 40 retrievers currently under Stewart tutelage . Their respective summer training schedules may vary due to age differences and natural ability but there is consistency to their lessons . Here is a brief refresher course per Stewart instruction on how you might start readying your dog for what is shaping up as another banner waterfowl hunting season . Most tips best apply to retrievers that have had at least some previous training .1 Obedience With a TwistBasic obedience should be an integral part of your training . Heel sit stay whistle and steadying drills should all be addressed . In addition since duck hunters often tromp through water of varying depth Stewart believes in training retrievers to heel in the dog under control while you are wading . We will take puppies and heel them so that when they are in say deep water situations they are by our side Stewart says . We want that dog to hover . Like duck hunters retrievers often are required to sit still for extended stretches of time . We also teach the dogs to sit on stumps on water stands and in water for long periods Stewart says . These are obedience drills and summer in water is an excellent time to work on those things . 2 Steadying to Shot Some people think they can get their dog in shape by repetitively throwing bumpers . But that really counterproductive to steadiness Stewart says . And steadiness according to Stewart is critical to your dog development . He employs a number of methods when teaching steadiness . One technique is linked to clay target shooting . Stewart will bring together three or four gunners and their dogs and position them either on buckets like a dove shoot or in simulated blinds . Clay targets are launched . Once every five or six shots a bumper will be tossed . But only one dog will be sent to retrieve the bumper . Each dog is allowed only two or three retrieves per outing . This exercise also reinforces honoring . Stewart sometimes uses mechanical launchers . The dog is taught not to seek out the bumper until after getting the OK from the handler . If your dog has a propensity to bolt at the site of a rising bumper or at the sound of a gun shot attach a lead to the retriever collar and steady the animal the next time a bumper goes up or a shot is fired . A couple of jerks on the lead may be required before the retriever learns that it is not supposed to flee until after being released by the handler .3 Marking Marking drills need not be done in open fields or big stretches of open water . Once a dog is using its eyes and marking well it does take any more than from two to six good marks a day and the dog is back on it Stewart says . What you should be doing is more complex marks like in woodlands . People do not spend enough time on that . Stewart suggests tossing bumpers from fields into cover or from cover into fields . Get the dog tuned up to hunt the cover to hunt the grass at the edge of water Stewart says . Teach the dog to get into that cover because if a duck is shot or wounded it will usually head toward cover . Do not forget marks that require the dog going over barriers . I would do some marks across ditches across fences and across water Stewart says . That what the dog is going to have to deal with in the field . 4 LiningThe straighter the line a dog runs toward a mark the less handling one is likely to have to do . The object of these drills is to get the dog holding lines Stewart says . You have to put the back on them . Dogs will fade to the contor of the land in accordance with the wind or with natural barriers such as ditches or other obstacles . Teach them to run through the barriers Stewart says . You want the dog running a nice clean straight line instead of scalloping . One way to do this is to incorporate a natural or straight line into the training . These can be as simple as a fencerow or in a more urban environment a building . In either case the longer the better . Place the dog in a sit position . Then toss a bumper parallel to the fence or building either of which will then serve to discourage the dog from running wide . The hardest thing to get a dog to do is run deep Stewart says . With the fence you can teach the dog not to bow out . The dog should be running straight lines along the fence or building .'

That ice lens might go back several hundred feet he said .'
bucket	b'The buildup of air pollution resembles the filling of a leaky bucket . The size of the bucket is determined by vertical mixing while the leakiness is controlled by wind speed . You need a waterfall to fill an enormous bucket with many large leaks but a trickle of water could overflow a small bucket with a single pinhole .'
bucket	b'The vertical mixing that controls the bucket size is in turn controlled by inversions warm air lying over colder air . Since the colder air is denser it is unable to mix freely with the warmer air above .'
bucket	b'When winds are light and the sky is clear the size of the bucket in undisturbed areas is close to zero . In downtown Fairbanks where cars add heat as well as carbon monoxide the depth of the air layer is still only about thirty feet a very small bucket compared with more than a thousand feet in Los Angeles .'
bucket	b'In Anchorage clear skies and light wind speeds are not quite as common but when they occur the mixing depths are probably not much greater than in Fairbanks so the bucket is not much larger but the number of cars and thus the rate of fill is greater .'

bucket	b'As everyone knows the freezing of water causes the material to expand . Ice occupies a greater volume than does the water it formed from . While the expansion of water as it freezes is the underlying cause of bursting pipes and bent buckets the actual deformation or breakage of the water container results from a secondary consequence of the expansion namely hydraulic pressure in that part of the water last to freeze .'
bucket	b'A series of experiments described by John Houk in the Summer 1974 issue of the Northern Engineer illustrates the role of hydraulic pressure rather well . A metal bucket set on a block of styrofoam ends up with a bulged bottom created by the hydraulic pressure in the last water to freeze in this case at the bottom of the bucket . Yet if the styrofoam is placed on the top of the bucket no bulging occurs because the last water to freeze is near the top surface where there is no metal to be bent .'
bucket	b'Hence if one places a wooden or other insulating bucket filled with hot water out in the cold and places beside it a similar bucket equally filled with cold water the two will evaporate unequally . By the time both come down to the same temperature a temperature still above freezing the bucket originally containing hot water will contain less water than the one originally filled with cold . If the walls of the buckets are vertical both liquids contained therein still have the same surface area exposed to air so the rate of evaporation from this time on is essentially the same in both . Since cooling is presumed to continue to be only by evaporation the bucket with the least water must reach freezing temperature the soonest .'
bucket	b'Make a small hole in each side of the bucket about a half inch down . Place the wire through and bend each side so it wo come out . Then you bend the knife blade butter dish or whatever you have it has to be stainless steel so it will be down near the bottom of the bucket . A bit of it has to stick up enough so you can hook a wire clamp to it . I drilled a hole in each end of my clothes pin and fashioned a piece of wire into a hook at the top and on the bottom with the same piece of wire bent it so when a coin is clipped in it grasp it touches the wire . Attach the aligator clips to the wire ends .'
bucket	b'Field Test It is recommended that for the most efficient operation you should screen your material down to quarter inch size and smaller . At this size the pan is it most efficient . I was able to pan a 5 gallon bucket of material very quickly . In only a half hour I was able to go through this bucket . With more practice I sure It would go much faster . I am not particularly fast with a conventional pan . A 5 gallon bucket would take me hours A lot of care goes into using a conventional pan or you lose lots of GOLD . You can be deliberately abrupt in your use of the Grizzly Gold Pan . The panning motion is not circular as with a conventional gold pan . The motion is a much easier side to side motion holding the pan level . The light material flows out the sides at the end of each motion . The momentum of the material in the pan carries the light material over the edge while the ridges keep the gold inside the pan . Each change of direction allows the gold to move down toward the bottom of the pan while the lighter material flows over the sides . At the end of the panning process I actually used a conventional pan to see what I got . Removing the seal at the bottom of the grizzly pan allows you to remove the GOLD .'

Large budgets and accompanying bureaucracy are probably inescapable in today context our goals have also become far more complex and sophisticated than they used to be . It is useful to remember however that Ames worked equally as effectively albeit differently when the modus operandi was what we might now call primitive . funding and the increasing involvement of bureaucracy in the daily life of research are not reasons for Ames success dedication to creative thinking is .

bucket	b'Seven years passed from project initiation to the final flight of the seventh Surveyor . In 1964 at the midpoint in development technical and management problems were obvious . This was the year that the vernier engines contractor encountered such severe technical difficulties that the JPL project office terminated the contract with Reaction Motors Division RMD and sought an alternative source . This step was taken and the results presented to us at Headquarters as a fait accompli after acceptable progress seemed hopeless . Although upset by this precipitous action we went along with the initiation of a new development contract with Space Technology Laboratories STL for replacement verniers . The gravity of the situation caused me to become personally involved and one of the first things I did was visit both STL and RMD . It became obvious that we really were in a bind the RMD hardware was in short supply test results had been spotty their manufacturing and test facilities were run down and poorly equipped I remember describing the place as a bucket shop to my associates and STL obviously needed time that we did not have to come up to speed .'

bucket	b'Apache2 Const OK to indicate that the filter has successfully finished . If the return value is Apache2 Const DECLINED modperl will read and forward the data on behalf of the filter . Please notice that this feature is specific to modperl . If there is some problem with obtaining or sending the bucket brigades or the buckets in it filters need to return the error returned by the method that tried to manipulate the bucket brigade or the bucket . Normally it be an APR constant .'
bucket	b'A bucket represents a chunk of data . Buckets linked together comprise a brigade . Each bucket in a brigade can be modified removed and replaced with another bucket . The goal is to minimize the data copying where possible . Buckets come in different types such as files data blocks end of stream indicators pools etc. . To manipulate a bucket one does need to know its internal representation .'
bucket	b'The stream of data is represented by bucket brigades . When a filter is called it gets passed the brigade that was the output of the previous filter . This brigade is then manipulated by the filter e.g. by modifying some buckets and passed to the next filter in the stack .'
bucket	b'The figure tries to show that after the presented bucket brigade has passed through several filters some buckets were removed some modified and some added . Of course the handler that gets the brigade can not tell the history of the brigade it can only see the existing buckets in the brigade .'
bucket	b'Now let look at the following two examples of connection handlers . The first using the connection socket to read and write the data and the second using bucket brigades to accomplish the same and allow for connection filters to do their work .'
bucket	b'Now let look at the same module but this time implemented by manipulating bucket brigades and which runs its output through a connection output filter that turns all uppercase characters into their lowercase equivalents .'
bucket	b'The handler receives the incoming data via bucket bridges one at a time in a loop . It then process each bridge by retrieving the buckets contained in it reading the data in then creating new buckets using the received data and attaching them to the outgoing brigade . When all the buckets from the incoming bucket brigade were transformed and attached to the outgoing bucket brigade a flush bucket is created and added as the last bucket so when the outgoing bucket brigade is passed out to the outgoing connection filters it wo be buffered but sent to the client right away .'
bucket	b'Notice that this handler could be much simpler since we do modify the data . We could simply pass the whole brigade unmodified without even looking at the buckets . But from this example you can see how to write a connection handler where you actually want to read modify the data . To accomplish that modification simply add a code that transforms the data which has been read from the bucket before it inserted to the outgoing brigade .'
bucket	b'Apache 2.0 considers all incoming and outgoing data as chunks of information disregarding their kind and source or storage methods . These data chunks are stored in buckets which form bucket brigades . Input and output filters massage the data in bucket brigades . Response and protocol handlers also receive and send data using bucket brigades though in most cases this is hidden behind wrappers such as read and print . modperl 2.0 filters can directly manipulate the bucket brigades or use the simplified streaming interface where the filter object acts similar to a filehandle which can be read from and printed to .'
bucket	b'Even though you do use bucket brigades directly when you use the streaming filter interface which works on bucket brigades behind the scenes it still important to understand bucket brigades . For example you need to know that an output filter will be invoked as many times as the number of bucket brigades sent from an upstream filter or a content handler . Or you need to know that the end of stream indicator EOS is sometimes sent in a separate bucket brigade so it should be a surprise that the filter was invoked even though no real data went through . As we delve into the filter details you will see that understanding bucket brigades will help to understand how filters work .'
bucket	b'Unlike other Apache handlers filter handlers may get invoked more than once during the same request . Filters get invoked as many times as the number of bucket brigades sent from an upstream filter or a content provider .'
bucket	b'Filters should never make an assumption that the EOS bucket is arriving alone in a bucket brigade . Therefore the first output filter will be invoked two or three times three times if EOS is coming in its own brigade depending on the number of bucket brigades sent by the response handler .'
bucket	b'A user may install an upstream filter and that filter may decide to insert extra bucket brigades or collect all the data in all bucket brigades passing through it and send it all down in one brigade .'
bucket	b'In more complicated filters the filters may need to buffer data first before the transformation can be applied . For example if the filter operates on html tokens e.g. it possible that one brigade will include the beginning of the token will come in the next bucket brigade on the next filter invocation . In certain cases it may involve more than two bucket brigades to get the whole token . In such a case the filter will have to store the remainder of unprocessed data in the filter context and then reuse it on the next invocation . Another good example is a filter that performs data compression compression is usually effective only when applied to relatively big chunks of data so if a single bucket brigade does contain enough data the filter may need to buffer the data in the filter context till it collects enough of it .'
bucket	b'This check should be done at the end of the filter handler because sometimes the EOS token comes attached to the tail of data the last invocation gets both the data and EOS and sometimes it comes all alone the last invocation gets only EOS . So if this test is performed at the beginning of the handler and the EOS bucket was sent in together with the data the EOS event may be missed and filter wo function properly .'
bucket	b'All filters excluding the core filter that reads from the network and the core filter that writes to it block at least once when invoked . Depending on whether this is an input or an output filter the blocking happens when the bucket brigade is requested from the upstream filter or when the bucket brigade is passed to the downstream filter .'
bucket	b'First of all the input and output filters differ in the ways they acquire the bucket brigades which includes the data that they filter . Even though when a streaming API is used the difference ca be seen it important to understand how things work underneath . Therefore we are going to show examples of transparent filters which pass data through them unmodified . Instead of reading the data in and printing it out the bucket brigades are now passed as is .'
bucket	b'Now let look at what happens in the output filters chain . Here the first filter acquires the bucket brigades containing the response data from the content handler or another protocol handler if we are talking HTTP it then may apply some modification and pass the data to the next filter using the passbrigade call which in turn applies its modifications and sends the bucket brigade to the next filter etc. all the way down to the last filter called core which writes the data to the network via the socket the client is listening to . Even though the output filters do have to wait to acquire the bucket brigade since the upstream filter passes it to them as an argument they still block in a similar fashion to input filters since they have to wait for the passbrigade call to return .'
bucket	b'Notice that for HTTP requests the only difference between connection filters and request filters is that the former see everything the headers and the body whereas the latter see only the body . modperl provides two interfaces to filtering a direct bucket brigades manipulation interface and a simpler interface . The examples in the following sections will help you to understand the difference between the two interfaces .'
bucket	b'If we are in the input mode in the same call we retrieve the bucket brigade from the previous filter on the input filters stack and immediately link it to the bb variable which makes the bucket brigade available to the next input filter when the filter handler returns . If we forget to perform this linking our filter will become a black hole in which data simply disappears . Next we call bbdump which dumps the type of the filter and the contents of the bucket brigade to STDERR without influencing the normal data flow .'
bucket	b'If we are in the output mode the bb variable already points to the current bucket brigade . Therefore we can read the contents of the brigade right away . After that we pass the brigade to the next filter .'
bucket	b'First we can see the connection input filter at work as it processes the HTTP headers . We can see that for this request each header is put into a separate brigade with a single bucket . The data is conveniently enclosed by so you can see the new line characters as well .'
bucket	b'Here the HTTP header has been terminated by a double new line . So far all the buckets were of the HEAP type meaning that they were allocated from the heap memory . Notice that the HTTP request input filters will never see the bucket brigades with HTTP headers as it has been consumed by the last core connection filter .'
bucket	b'This happens because Apache has sent yet the response HTTP headers to the client . The request filter sees a bucket brigade with a single bucket of type TRANSIENT which is allocated from the stack memory .'
bucket	b'Create a new empty bucket brigade ctxbb pass it to the upstream filter via getbrigade and wait for this call to return . When it returns ctxbb is populated with buckets . Now the filter should move the bucket from ctxbb to bb on the way modifying the buckets if needed . Once the buckets are moved and the filter returns the downstream filter will receive the populated bucket brigade .'
bucket	b'Pass bb to getbrigade to the upstream filter so it will be populated with buckets . Once getbrigade returns the filter can go through the buckets and modify them in place or it can do nothing and just return in which case the downstream filter will receive the bucket brigade unmodified .'
bucket	b'Both techniques allow addition and removal of buckets . Though the second technique is more efficient since it does have the overhead of create the new brigade and moving the bucket from one brigade to another . In this example we have chosen to use the second technique in the next example we will see the first technique .'
bucket	b'As promised in this filter handler we have used the first technique of bucket brigade modification . The handler creates a temporary bucket brigade ctxbb populates it with data using getbrigade and then moves buckets from it to the bucket brigade bb which is then retrieved by the downstream filter when our handler returns .'
bucket	b'Now you probably ask yourself why did we have to go through the bucket brigades filters when this all can be done so much simpler . The reason is that we wanted you to understand how the filters work underneath which will assist a lot when you will need to debug filters or optimize their speed . In certain cases a bucket brigade filter may be more efficient than the . For example if the filter applies transformation to selected buckets certain buckets may contain open filehandles or pipes rather than real data . And when you call read the buckets will be forced to read that data in . But if you did want to modify these buckets you could pass them as they are and let Apache do faster techniques for sending data from the file handles or pipes .'
bucket	b'It only possible to get more than one bucket brigade from the same filter handler invocation if the filter is not using the streaming interface and by simply calling getbrigade as many times as needed or till EOS is received .'
bucket	b'In order not to distract the reader from the purpose of the example the used code is oversimplified and wo handle correctly input lines which are longer than 1024 characters and possibly using a different line termination token could be n r or r n depending on a platform . Moreover a single line may be split between across two or even more bucket brigades so we have to store the unprocessed string in the filter context so it can be used on the following invocations .'
bucket	b'The bucket brigades output filter version is just a bit more complicated than the one . The handler receives the incoming bucket brigade bb as its second argument . Since when the handler is completed it must pass a brigade to the next filter in the stack we create a new bucket brigade into which we are going to put the modified buckets and which eventually we pass to the next filter .'
bucket	b'The core of the handler is in removing buckets from the head of the bucket brigade bb while there are some reading the data from the buckets reversing and putting it into a newly created bucket which is inserted to the end of the new bucket brigade . If we see a bucket which designates the end of stream we insert that bucket to the tail of the new bucket brigade and break the loop . Finally we pass the created brigade with modified data to the next filter and return .'
bucket	b'Sometimes filters need to read at least N bytes before they can apply their transformation . It quite possible that reading one bucket brigade is not enough . But two or more are needed . This situation is sometimes referred to as an underrun .'
bucket	b'Let take an input filter as an example . When the filter realizes that it does have enough data in the current bucket brigade it can store the read data in the filter context and wait for the next invocation of itself which may or may not satisfy its needs . Meanwhile it must return an empty bb to the upstream input filter . This is not the most efficient technique to resolve underruns .'
bucket	b'Instead of returning an empty bb the input filter can initiate the retrieval of extra bucket brigades until the underrun condition gets resolved . Notice that this solution is absolutely transparent to any filters before or after the current filter .'
bucket	b'It is clear from the debugging output that the filter was invoked only three times instead of six times there were six bucket brigades . Notice that the upstread input filter if any was aware that there were six bucket brigades since it saw only three . Our example filter did do much with those tokens so it has only repackaged data from 8kb per bucket brigade to 16389 bytes per bucket brigade . But of course in real world some transformation is applied on these tokens .'
bucket	b'The filter calls getbrigade in a loop till it reads enough data or sees EOS . Notice that it may get underruns for several times and then suddenly receive a lot of data at once which will be enough for more than one minimal size token so we have to take care this into an account . Once the underrun condition is satisfied we have at least one complete token the tokens are put into a bucket brigade and returned to the upstream filter for processing keeping any remainders in the filter context for the next invocations or flushing all the remaining data if EOS has been seen .'
bucket	b'In this module we use flattenbb to read the data from the buckets and signal when the EOS is received . The filter simply collects the data storing it in the filter context . When it receives EOS it sets the header and sends the data out .'
bucket	b'If a filter desires to store the incoming buckets for post processing . It must check whether the bucket type is transient . If it is the data must be copied away . If not the buckets may contain corrupted data when used later . The right thing is accomplished transparently by aprbucketsetaside for which we need to provide a perl glue .'

umbrella	b'Lycopene Another Defense Against the Most Common CancerEach year more than one million new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer are diagnosed in the U.S. This number is greater than the incidence of all other cancers combined . To prevent and treat this type of skin cancer Huachen Wei M.D. Ph.D. M.P.H. is looking at lycopene in an study . There are two kinds of skin cancers melanomas and nonmelanomas . Non melanoma skin cancer is the more common one and it includes basal and squamous cell carcinomas . Although nonmelanoma skin cancers are highly treatable approximately 650 million is spent each year on treatment . This cost to the healthcare system along with the related deaths per year calls for prevention . Another reason for prevention is that the incidence of human skin cancers has increased significantly in the past 20 years and continues to increase at the alarming rate of four percent per year on average . Dr. Huachen Wei Professor of Dermatology and Director of Dermatology Research Laboratories at Mount Sinai Medical Center thinks that sunscreen lotions are partly at fault . The early sunscreen applications of the 1980s did not always protect a person from UVA radiation which can contribute to skin cancer he says . However UVB radiation is the better known cause of skin cancer especially in the presence of other factors like benzopyrene which is found in cigarette smoke . UVA and UVB rays are the two kinds of ultraviolet radiation that reach the earth surface . The Antioxidant in TomatoesLycopene the phytochemical in tomatoes and their products could possibly be used to prevent or treat skin cancer caused by UVB rays . Although lycopene has shown an anticancer effect against other cancers like breast and prostate cancers it has never been tested as a preventive agent against skin cancer says Dr. Wei . Epidemiological studies show however that those who consume more lycopene have less skin cancer . In his laboratory study Dr. Wei and his colleagues will feed lycopene to hairless mice in different amounts and then expose them to UVB rays to see how well lycopene inhibits carcinogenesis . After 50 percent of the mice have developed tumors they will stop UVB exposure and continue to give of the mice lycopene to see if it reduces the size of tumors . Because other studies show that a high dose of lycopene can be given animals to delay or reduce the volume of tumors it could possibly become part of a cancer treatment . Lycopene has no obvious toxicity says Dr. Wei . The Next StepIf this study is successful and Dr. Wei confirms lycopene effect against the initiation and progression of skin cancer by measuring biomarkers a human trial will be started at Mount Sinai Hospital . A similar skin cancer study that Dr. Wei conducted with genistein also funded by AICR has already been translated into a clinical trial there . The clinical trial would see whether dietary lycopene can prevent skin cancer among people at for it like patients with kidney transplants or psoriatic patients receiving PUVA psoralen and ultraviolet A treatments according to Dr. Wei . As a practicing dermatologist and cancer researcher Dr. Wei always advises people to use a sunscreen that protects against both UVA and UVB rays and has an SPF factor in the range of 30 to 60 to help prevent skin cancer . If you are active outdoors he recommends reapply it every 3 hours . A shirt pants and a hat even an umbrella offer good protection too . However you should try to avoid outdoor activity from 10 am to 3 pm when the rays are strongest . ReferenceZsuzsanna Fazekas et al . Protective effects of lycopene against ultraviolet photodamage .

I noted that problems in arms negotiations should not be permitted to thwart or imperil the entire relationship and similarly that sometimes negotiations in other areas could assist in speeding up the arms control process .

umbrella	b'Two of the most successful conservation programs in Conservation Reserve Program CRP and Wetlands Reserve Program WRP are facing termination . This is an unfortunate circumstance that we hope to see averted . The continued of waterfowl and other wildlife may hang in the balance . The varied agricultural programs administered by the federal government fall under the umbrella of what has become known as the Farm Bill . This includes myriad rules regulations and financial incentives involving farming ranching and forestry . Ducks Unlimited and its membership have a vested interest in agricultural legislation and its impact on wetlands and waterfowl habitat conservation . CRP has created millions of acres of nesting habitat for a variety of birds including ducks and pheasants . The Prairie Pothole Region of the northern Great Plains produces tens of millions of migratory birds every year . CRP lands studies have shown yield high waterfowl nest success rates sometimes triple that of other habitat . WRP also plays an important role in the life cycle of migratory birds . Here the focus is primarily on wintering and migration habitat . WRP has restored nearly one million acres of habitat throughout the nation . How By compensating farmers for retiring croplands that were prior wetlands . CRP and WRP are both popular within the agricultural community . Payments derived from these programs have provided many farmers the wherewithal to keep their operations going . Indeed for every person currently approved to enroll land in WRP there are five individuals waiting in line for the opportunity to enroll their own acreage . Demand to enroll in CRP and WRP currently exceeds enrollment ceilings imposed by Congress . Ducks Unlimited has joined dozens of the nation wildlife conservation organizations to express support for CRP and WRP . You too can help by letting your congressional representatives know of your support for these important programs . Votes speak loudly .

umbrella	b'As indicated in a labeled detail from 20475 the source of the reflected sunlight is to our left and below the pattern on the umbrella . Specifically we see that when features in the pattern are traced from the left they continue onto the ribs but are then interupted because the reflection is shadowed by the ribs .'
umbrella	b'The face plates are easily eliminated because reflections off their curved surfaces could be seen from many locations not just a small area . Rather the reflector must be a relatively flat surface of roughly the same size as the pattern on the umbrella .'
umbrella	b'A final piece of evidence is provided by a further comparison of the three photos Jack took of Gene . The TV record of this part of the mission clearly shows that Ed Fendell was panning the camera from right to left during the time Jack was taking the three Hasselblad images . Changes in the pointing direction of the TV can be seen in the three photos . Examination of details of the reflection on the umbrella shows that the pattern correlates well with position of the camera .'
umbrella	b'Our analysis strongly indicates that the pattern seen on the umbrella is a reflection off the top of the TV camera . However there is one aspect of the phenomenon that is not completely explained . If the top of the camera was perfectly flat the pattern on the umbrella should have a shape similar to the shape of mirrored top of the camera with only minor difference due to the curvature of the umbrella .'

umbrella	b'Conceptually and administratively the NASA program was the umbrella under which projects were identified and planned Congressional authorization and appropriations obtained private sector sources solicited and evaluated contract awards made and contracts administered . Thus the interests of NASA program and project managers became closely intertwined with the interests of actual and prospective contractors . In turn because programs and projects were managed through NASA centers the institutional health of the centers became intertwined with the interests of program managers and aerospace contractors . And because Congress necessarily attended to constituent interests that included the communities in which NASA centers and contractors were located Congressional interest in NASA programs reached well beyond the degree to which they might meet broad national aerospace policy goals .'
umbrella	b'advanced sustaining research administrative costs both mundane and noble but not billable to a particular project was harder to come by than appropriations for projects and programs .

This model assumed that research and development priorities would be established by life scientists and that researchers would not be constrained by such matters as the 51 applied value of their work or the necessity of meeting deadlines . NASA of course was patterned on the engineering research and development model of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics in which engineers and physical scientists decided research and development priorities Moreover NASA major mission depended ultimately on concepts developed by engineers and physical scientists and it was under pressure to meet specific deadlines .

umbrella	b'A number of factors shaping the development of satellite communications in Europe emerge from Sebesta perceptive study . She demonstrates the interweaving of U.S. and European satellite communications policy . She also discusses how the United States could use its commanding position to dominate the negotiations that led to the creation of the umbrella organization for the unified global satellite communications system and to garner for U.S. industry as a consequence of that commanding position the largest share of Intelsat contracts . The United States sought to impose its will on Europe through these negotiations especially the clause relating to the creation of regional satellite systems and the geographical definition of the European broadcast space . However the U.S. position was not based solely on its technological and industrial lead it was closely associated with security concerns specifically the transfer of sensitive technology and generally the NATO alliance . Sebesta sheds light too on some of the motives behind . NASA attempts to foster cooperation with its European partners such as the desire to channel funding away from military ends and toward peaceful uses of space . In turn for example West Germany hoped to acquire military related technologies denied it by treaties dating from the end of World War II .'

umbrella	b'Another drawback to Intersputnik involved a number of ambiguities in the draft proposal . One concerned system ownership . Article 3 2 stated that the satellites could be the property of Intersputnik or leased to Intersputnik by its member states . As Stephen E. Doyle wrote this provision could be construed as a Soviet effort to ensure that the USSR would be able to provide at least some of the space segment requirements of the international system to the organization on a lease basis with the USSR collecting the rent . 61 It follows that in contrast to Intelsat Intersputnik would be a coordinating umbrella organization rather than one that is the sole owner of the space segment . However similar to Intelsat Article 3 4 of the draft stated that the ground complex shall be the property of the States which have constructed it in their territory . A further ambiguity in the Intersputnik proposal concerned the lack of any requirement that there be nondiscriminatory access for all users a requirement clearly stated in the Preamble to the Intelsat agreement . On the other hand Article 10 of the Communist draft stated that the distribution of communications channels among states members of the organization shall be made on the basis of their need for communications channels . Paragraph 2 of the same article stipulated however that states had to pay for its channels at fixed rates which was certainly a strange albeit understandable requirement for a Communist organization ideologically committed to the proposition From each according to his ability to each according to his needs .'

mailbox	b'This shows that Wolk and Luddy categorization is strong with respect to availability and weaker in the areas of confidentiality and integrity . Indeed upon closer examination it becomes apparent that there are ways to violate confidentiality and integrity which do not constitute sabotage theft of services or property crimes . For example a Trojan horse could append code to a word processor which sends copies of a user confidential text as messages to the perpetrator electronic mailbox . This is sabotage because no AIS functionality was destroyed or even altered theft of services does not apply if the perpetrator is paying for his electronic mail account and unless the confidential text was copyrighted it is not a property crime . This analysis is significant because it demonstrates that examining a legal concept from a technical perspective can yield insights into its strengths and weaknesses and even suggest avenues for improvement .'
mailbox	b'If access mode controls are placed only on the directories then once a user is given any access to a directory he has the same access to all files under this directory . Of course if one of the objects under this directory is another directory which we call a subdirectory then users need access mode permission to the subdirectory before they can access the objects under the subdirectory . Placing access controls only on directories requires users to group files according to access types . This requirement could be too constrictive and could conflict with other reasons for grouping files . If access mode controls are placed only on files then controls are of a finer granularity . Access to individual files is controlled independently of other files under the same directory . But if no access controls are placed on directories users could browse through the storage structure looking at the names of other users files . Also there is no control on where in the tree structure a subject could place a file and this is usually the main purpose of a tree structure . By having the access mode controls on both directories and files a subject needs the correct access mode permissions to both the directory and the file before it is allowed to access the file . Access modes for files are the basic software and hardware implemented access modes such as those listed in Section 8.2 since the operating system has no knowledge of the semantics of the files . The rest of the objects directories mailboxes etc. are data structures maintained by the operating system and their access modes are generally more elaborate extensions of the basic access modes and are usually implemented by protected subsystems . In a system like UNIX the lack of execute access implies no access to the existing entire under that directory ignoring an implementation of links as in UNIX and our earlier discussion of access permissions . A user can not give another user access to a file without also giving the correct read access to the parent directories .'

mailbox	b'By Fred BurtonA federal jury in New Jersey recently convicted the group Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty SHAC and six of its key members on charges related to their radical tactics targeting Huntingdon Life Science Inc. HLS . The charges are tied to the group efforts to post personal information about people associated with HLS on the Internet information that was then used by other activists to harass threaten and generally terrorize those targets . The organization was convicted of all six federal charges conspiracy to violate the Animal Enterprise Protection Act conspiracy to commit interstate stalking three counts of interstate stalking of specific victims and conspiracy to use a telecommunications device to abuse threaten and harass persons . The individual defendants all of whom were found guilty of at least one charge are set for sentencing in June . Despite the hopes of HLS executives and others who have been targeted the convictions are not likely to pose much of a setback for SHAC which has achieved significant successes with its radical campaign tactics . The group was formed in 1999 in Britain specifically for the purpose of driving HLS which uses animals in testing drugs chemicals and consumer items for harmful side effects out of business . Over the years that campaign has come to mean that the group targets not only HLS executives but also employees and executives of other companies from investors to local contractors and service providers that do business with HLS . And it targets them in highly personal ways . Tactics have included personal harassment intimidation character defamation vandalism and arson . SHAC activists pursue their targets not only at their places of work but at their homes their children schools in restaurants and other public and private locations . Such tenacious campaigns have dramatically weakened HLS but even more significantly other activist groups have noticed and now appear to be adopting SHAC tactics and larger strategy . Against this backdrop SHAC federal convictions the most serious of which carries a maximum prison sentence of six years and a fine are not likely to have a tremendous impact . SHAC members are passionately committed to their cause and past legal injunctions and convictions such as a prison sentence for member Sarah Gisbourne in Britain have had more of a martyring than a chilling effect on the group campaigns . In fact shortly after the SHAC convictions were announced this month an Earth First member posted this message on the Internet NOW is the time to take steps to boost your own security to insulate people from possible snitches and to increase the pressure on HLS or whatever your favorate sic cor pse orate target is in order to retaliate . Protect yourself and your comrades and MAKE CORPORATE AMERIKKKA PAY for this shit Loose Structure Holistic StrategySHAC opposition to vivisection has caused the group to cross the Atlantic in pursuit of HLS a company its members have attacked from just about every conceivable angle . SHAC grand strategy assumes that by making it very costly for any company to do business with HLS the research group will be driven out of business and SHAC will have scored a significant victory for the activists cause . SHAC is an international campaign . In the United States it has been particularly active around HLS headquarters in New Jersey but SHAC members have taken actions against targets from New York to California and from Florida to Washington state . Within the broader animal rights movement SHAC operates in parallel with and to some degree overlaps the radical Animal Liberation Front ALF . Like the ALF SHAC is not an organized group in the standard sense since it lacks defined membership and a clear command structure . It does however have an identifiable leadership the current president of SHAC USA is former child actress Pamelyn Ferdin who is known for roles as the voice of Lucy in the Peanuts comic strip movies Sally in The Cat in the Hat and as Felix Unger daughter in the Odd Couple TV show . The people involved with SHAC can be roughly divided into three tiers . The smallest would be those who engage in illegal activities and the group wealthy donors who give anonymously . The second tier consists of those willing to engage in legal acts of harassment attend rallies and collect and disseminate the personal information of potential targets . The largest tier comprises mainly passive sympathizers including employees at target companies who might disclose the confidential addresses and phone numbers of their coworkers and bosses . Since there is no formal membership the numbers are in no way fixed anyone can wake up tomorrow read about SHAC on the Internet and engage in an activity that night that propels them directly into the first tier . The type of harassment and vandalism carried out by SHAC and ALF has been limited only by the activists creativity and imagination . Among the nonviolent tactics are vocal protests outside the homes of corporate executives sometimes in the middle of the night crank phone calls and subscribing targeted businesspeople to numerous magazines sometimes including pornography . SHAC USA activists claim to have called the church of one executive and made allegations that he inappropriately touched children at the church . They have positioned mobile billboards in addition to wanted posters throughout a target neighborhood . In at least one case SHAC USA activists approached and harassed the child of an executive at the child school . They also distributed pamphlets at the school detailing what they viewed as the company misdeeds . Acts of vandalism claimed by SHAC run the gamut from strewing trash and setting off alarms outside a target home to detonating stink bombs inside businesses . More significant property attacks have involved throwing bricks and bottles of urine through windows and and cars . Foam often has been used to clog car exhaust pipes and locks . In one case SHAC claims to have completely defaced the home of HLS chief executive Andrew Baker . The excerpt below was posted to SHAC USA Web site On Sunday July 18 we caught wind that an activist in New York had been arrested at a peaceful protest at CEO Andrew Baker New York home . This did not settle well with us . Activists decided to take matters into our own hands by paying a visit to Andrew Baker Los Angeles home . We swarmed the home and jumped right over the wall around his house . We set off a strip of firecrackers . The noise and sparks were just the beginning of our work . By the time we were ready to leave there were broken planter boxes a destroyed fountain busted windows and smashed security cameras . The garbage cans tipped over and there was glass and garbage everywhere . Andrew does even have a mailbox anymore . It was kicked into pieces . Nothing was left the way we found it . Scare tactics also are widely used by the activists . In one case a mangled crucified voodoo doll was placed on the doorstep of the daughter of a CEO at one of HLS supplier companies . Another executive found his name spelled out with expended shotgun shells in his driveway a live shell with a note reading ominously One of Two was left nearby . Some activists claim they have sent hoax bombs to frighten their targets and people associated with SHAC have hacked computers stolen credit card information sent spam email to their targets and even hacked into the frequent flyer account of one person in the United States . Scare tactics for instance a message reading How would you like to see your son dismembered alive sometimes appear to threaten violence but more often are intended to draw parallels with the suffering the activists say animals experience in HLS business operations . Occasionally however activists do become violent . For example an activist from Berkeley Calif. is being sought in connection with a series of pipe bombings in August and September 2003 that targeted Chiron Corp. and Shaklee Inc. companies that have ties to HLS . There is evidence that in one of those cases the bomber intended to inflict serious harm One of the pipe bombs apparently was timed with a delay in order to injure emergency responders . And in February 2001 HLS managing director was nearly beaten to death by three men wielding pickax handles . It probably would be inaccurate to suggest that this act was orchestrated by SHAC leadership since most SHAC activity is conducted autonomously and this beating does not fit SHAC general tactical pattern . activists generally do not condone violent action but neither do they always condemn it in very strong terms sometimes labeling the anger that prompts it understandable . Whether condoned or not however the efforts of SHAC members have been brutally effective banks pension funds and insurance companies have abandoned HLS as have service companies such as Xerox Federal Express and UPS . According to information published on SHAC Web sites the group claims it has caused more than 160 companies and organizations to stop doing business with HLS . And HLS is now experiencing significant financial problems It was dropped from the New York Stock Exchange in 2000 as a result of SHAC activities and delisted from the London Stock Exchange the following year . Facing insolvency in England HLS reincorporated in Maryland as Life Sciences Research Inc. in 2002 . It was to be listed on the NYSE in 2005 but the listing was postponed when SHAC published names and contact information of NYSE officials . and Evolving CampaignsBecause SHAC methods have been so effective measured in terms of how many companies have severed ties to HLS and the economic damage done to HLS and its shareholders there is a high likelihood that they will be adopted by other groups in the animal rights and environmentalist movements . There is a great deal of interaction among these groups SHAC members have been or are currently involved with Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and Sea Shepherd Conservation Society . Moreover there is much encouragement among these groups to emulate successful tactics used by others . As the Ruckus Society puts it in its Action Planning Manual Openness to new ideas also includes the ability to see good ideas in other quarters and appropriate them . You ca copyright an action so do be afraid to steal good ideas . Become a student of the ways other groups or individuals are taking action . Pay special attention to direct actions by groups who are doing some of the most creative stuff today . The Ruckus Society also conducts live training sessions for activist groups where members of organizations like SHAC and ALF rub shoulders with activists from Greenpeace the Rainforest Action Network RAN the Earth Liberation Front ELF and other groups . It is easy to see the that occurs after such training sessions . For example several different flavors of activist groups have used the same design for dragon sleeves devices protesters use to lock themselves together and to buildings and other structures . Activists from various groups frequently use the same climbing techniques during banner drops and the same techniques to conduct surveillance of potential targets as well . Perhaps the most famous example of occurred when ALF posted a document titled Setting Fires with Electrical Timers An ELF Guide to its Web site . Of course some tactics used by SHAC were used by others before it . Organizations like AIDS activist group ACT UP and the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El Salvador have occasionally protested at the homes of people they hoped to influence sent letters to their homes or made crank calls to their residential phones . Where SHAC differs from these groups and the seed it is now spreading is in its and relentless execution of the tactic and in the considerable amount of damage it has caused to personal property . Future ImplicationsThis tactical between SHAC and other activist groups might already be bearing fruit . A year ago RAN began to target the CEO of a major financial services company at his home in Greenwich Conn. by placing Wild wanted posters in his neighborhood . Two RAN members were arrested in connection with that incident but Dan Firger a spokesman for RAN said at the time This is not going to go away and what happened on March 5 is not a fluke . Because so many other top executives and of corporations live in Greenwich it going to be very important to be able to come there and speak out in the public arena . More recently in December 2005 there were signs that his prediction was coming true The group Students for Bhopal staged a protest at the home of a former chemical company executive rapping on windows and yelling through bullhorns . The tactic of bringing the protest home to corporate executives is catching on . Though SHAC tactics are spreading it is impossible to predict to what degree the physical or psychological violence that have marked its actions will be matched by other groups . The level of violence in a campaign usually correlates to how much moral outrage activists feel is justified by the target actions . Put another way when activists are offended by what they view as the murder of animals or people such as in the 1984 Bhopal accident there is a greater tendency to use violence than in protests over less egregious offenses . That means that in most cases direct actions at the homes of corporate executives likely wo amount to more than harassment chanting and posters . But even these kinds of activity are sufficient to get the attention of executives and in the future possibly their counterparts at associated companies and result in major headaches for corporate security directors . Ultimately the conviction of the SHAC Six could serve to inspire more illegal activity rather than less and the trend could spread to involve larger numbers of groups and industries . Industries that are closely associated with human health pollution or environmental issues chemicals mining or drilling pharmaceuticals cosmetics and forestry products companies for example may be at particular risk but given the tactics in play the threat also could be extrapolated to include financial and other service providers who count these companies as customers . Many of those who have been targeted by SHAC in the past had hoped that since the group likely has no more than several dozen participants who are willing to risk arrest these few could now be jailed or discouraged by the fate of their counterparts leading to the collapse of the movement . Similarly there has been some speculation that if SHAC sources of funding could be identified and cut off the campaign would be choked . We view both outcomes however as unlikely not only do activists tend to rally around members who are jailed or otherwise punished for their actions but SHAC operating methods do not require large amounts of funding . At this point a few other groups are copying SHAC tactics but it is possible if not likely that many other activist will spawn radical wings that take a page from SHAC playbook and begin targeting the homes of corporate executives employees and board members .'

microwave	b'A Frozen dinners that limit fat and sodium content are a good start compared to many other frozen meals . Regular versions of these dinners can contain 30 to 55 grams of fat and 700 to milligrams mg of sodium per serving . You should check the nutrition information on these healthier dinners however . Some products designed for weight control reduce the fat and calorie content but sodium content can still be 600 to 800 mg . Depending on your other food choices for the day this high amount of sodium makes it difficult for a person to stay under the American Institute for Cancer Research AICR recommended limit of mg for the whole day . In fact the newest Institute of Medicine recommendations say that it best to stay under mg to prevent and control high blood pressure . If you plan to eat frozen dinners frequently the meals that keep sodium at 400 to 600 mg are better . You should also keep in mind that even the healthier frozen dinners can have small quantities of vegetables . In fact some products that feature vegetables in their name place cornstarch higher on the list of ingredients than any vegetable . If you create vegetable sides for the healthier kinds of frozen dinners you can have a delicious meal that is much more nutritious . While convenient frozen meals are heating open a bag of salad . Or microwave a bag of microwavable prewashed spinach serving it with a splash of balsamic vinegar or a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese .

microwave	b'LEMONS APPEAL ZEST AND ALLBy Dana Jacobi for the American Institute for Cancer ResearchWe rarely eat a lemon or use the entire fruit in pies chutneys or as they are for North African dishes . Yet we use lemons all the time often several times a day to enliven both savory and sweet dishes sauces dressings and beverages . Mostly we use the juice and occasionally the aromatic yellow outer layer of skin called the zest . A lemon is a lemon to Americans since the two commercially grown varieties Lisbon and Eureka are almost indistinguishable . Dark yellow Meyer lemons in season from November to March are now becoming more available as well . A cross between a lemon and an orange their abundant juice is sweet enough to drink straight . It makes a killer lemon juice has a bright taste . I highly recommend using it rather than bottled juice . To extract the most juice microwave a lemon for 30 seconds then roll it on the counter top pressing down firmly . Using a reamer a lemon yields as much as four tablespoons of juice . Lemon peel has two layers the top layer of golden zest rich in the phytochemical called limonen and a spongy underlayer of white pith . I favor two methods for removing the first and avoiding the second . If possible get a rasp . Chefs discovered that this tool zips zest off neatly yields more and cleans up more easily than a grater or zester . Alternatively use a vegetable peeler or sharp thin paring knife to cut the zest away in strips . If any white clings to the underside pin the peel on a flat surface using your thumb at one end . Holding a paring knife so its blade is almost horizontal gently slide the blade between the zest and pith starting at the and moving slowly down the strip . It does matter if the strip tears as you will probably be chopping it up anyway .'

microwave	b'The vast majority of Americans now recognize tobacco and excess sunlight as cancer risks . Yet there are many other equally legitimate cancer risks that the public continues to disregard . We still blaming cancer on factors beyond our control instead of concentrating on making simple lifestyle changes that could dramatically lower our risk . In a random telephone survey of over 1000 American adults conducted earlier this year by the American Institute for Cancer Research AICR 91 percent agreed that tobacco significantly increased cancer risk . percent named excess sunlight exposure as a risk . The reality supports these opinions . About 30 percent of U.S. cancer deaths are due to tobacco . And according to the National Cancer Institute NCI each increase in a person exposure to UVB radiation raises skin cancer risk 1 to 4 percent . Hereditary factors were cited as a significant cancer risk by 89 percent of those surveyed . The accuracy of this view depends on what respondents mean . Some forms of inherited genes do make a tiny minority of Americans more susceptible to damage from influences but experts say lifestyle still has impact . In fact numerous studies have shown that when populations migrate their cancer risk changes as their lifestyle changes . Survey respondents next identified external influences such as industrial pollution radiation and nuclear power as cancer risks . But these factors impact only very small segments of the population . Industrial chemicals are primarily a concern for workers who might receive exposures on the job . exposures from pollution pose negligible cancer risk to the general population . radiation the kind produced by microwave ovens seems to have no effect on cancer . Only radiation such as ultraviolet radiation from sunlight or tanning booths and radon can influence human cancer . To minimize these risks medical and dental are set at the lowest dose levels . Radon is a legitimate concern although its precise role in raising risk has chiefly been observed in studies among underground miners and smokers . Less than half the adults surveyed understood that diets low in fruits and vegetables significantly affect cancer risk . Such a poor showing suggests that years of research and public campaigns promoting fruit and vegetable consumption have not yet achieved their objective . According to the AICR expert report on diet and cancer risk if we boost fruit and vegetable consumption to at least five standard servings a day 20 percent of today cancers could be prevented . To make an even greater step towards cancer prevention AICR advises eating a diet with five to ten servings of fruits and vegetables daily . Only about a third of people surveyed identified diets high in red meat or lack of physical activity as cancer risks . Yet researchers say that limiting red meat getting regular exercise and a wide range of other lifestyle choices can dramatically lower our risk of cancer . Overall simple lifestyle changes could reduce cancer risk 30 to 40 percent . One encouraging improvement in public awareness came in the number of people who correctly identified obesity as a cancer risk . percent named obesity as a risk 10 percent more than two years ago . This is good news since overweight and obesity are estimated to account for 14 to 20 percent of all cancer deaths . The question now is whether this awareness will motivate more people to take action to thwart our epidemic of obesity .'

microwave	b'Boosting vegetable consumption is an important step to lowering cancer risk and promoting overall health but preparing them in a way that maximizes their nutritional value is important too . Scientific analysis shows that too much heat and water can cause the loss of some vitamins minerals and other healthful plant compounds called phytochemicals . The key to retaining vegetables nutrients is to cook them quickly and with little water . Boiling vegetables in a pan of water was long the traditional cooking method . Studies have found that this leads to loss of vitamins like vitamin C and folate an important B vitamin . Now studies show that certain antioxidant phytochemicals are also lost in cooking water . Broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables for example contain antioxidants called glucosinolates . When comparing boiled to steamed broccoli analysis found that steamed broccoli lost little of the vitamin C it contained when raw and contained more glucosinolates than boiled broccoli . This advantage of steaming rather than boiling vegetables was confirmed in another study with spinach and broccoli . Steaming produced no significant loss of folate even after 4.5 minutes of steaming spinach and 15 minutes steaming broccoli . Yet when these vegetables were cooked by boiling in water each lost more than half its folate . Another study showed that zucchini beans and carrots cooked in a small amount of water were significantly higher in phytochemicals called flavonoids than those cooked in larger amounts of water . In yet another study cruciferous vegetables including broccoli Brussels sprouts and cabbage lost about 90 percent of their glucosinolates when boiled but showed no significant loss when steamed microwaved or . The impact of cooking vegetables in a microwave depends upon how it is done . Microwaves offer the advantage of cooking vegetables quickly often even more quickly than steaming . A quick cooking time minimizes the loss of vitamins such as vitamins C and B including folate . The key is to use the least amount of water required . Broccoli immersed in water while cooking in a microwave lost 74 to 97 percent of its antioxidants in one study . But as long as there is just the minimal amount of water required studies show no significant loss of vitamins or healthful is another method of cooking that studies show retains nutrients and protective phytochemicals . It important to control the amount of oil you use since many vegetables absorb all the oil which is a concentrated source of calories . Although uses high temperatures vegetables are chopped into relatively small pieces . This causes them to cook quickly and to minimize the breakdown of nutrients . Oven roasting is another way to cook vegetables without immersing them in water . Because this involves higher temperatures for longer periods of time often 30 to 40 minutes at 400 degrees vegetables may lose a small amount of some nutrients when compared to other cooking methods . But there is no loss of vitamins or phytochemicals in cooking water . And for many vegetables including onions parsnips winter squash eggplant sweet potatoes and onions the flavor is so enhanced by this cooking method that it makes eating substantial portions a treat . There are plenty of ways you can use minimal cooking water and cooking time while still retaining vegetables flavor and nutrients . When steaming vegetables for example try adding to the water subtle flavors such as soy sauce or citrus . You can toss steamed orange vegetables with a small amount of honey or maple syrup .

microwave	b'Sweeten the Pot with Honey from the American Institute for Cancer Research Add a little sweetness to this autumn harvest vegetables . After all September is the peak of the honey harvest too and honey goes very nicely with many vegetables . Honey is simply the sweet liquid made by bees from flower nectar . Liquid honey is taken from the honeycomb and is often pasteurized to keep it from crystallizing . Whipped or creamed honey on the other hand is deliberately crystallized in a controlled way that keeps it spreadable at room temperature . If liquid honey crystallizes it can be reliquefied by placing the opened jar either in a microwave on high for about 30 seconds or in a pan of hot water over low heat for 10 to 15 minutes . There are more than 300 different honeys available in the United States each one from a different floral source . They are usually named for the flower they come from . Colors range from nearly colorless to dark brown and flavors from mild to strong . Generally the lighter the honey the milder the flavor . Honey is often used as a spread for bread and as a sweetener and flavoring agent for liquids and for both sweet and savory foods . You can even get honey in its natural packaging the edible comb . Many vegetables contain natural sugars that are heightened by browning them on the stove by or by broiling or grilling . A little honey makes them even sweeter . Throw in some apple and you have a side dish with a rich intense sweet taste . Each type of fruit or vegetable contains its own profile of nutrients and phytochemicals that fight chronic disease such as cancer diabetes stroke and heart disease . The varied textures and flavors of a variety of fruits and vegetables can complement each other and create a dish that is complex healthful and delicious . Honey adds a little extra sweetness to the mix along with small amounts of vitamins minerals and antioxidants . In the following recipe parsnips sweet potatoes and apples are roasted in a sauce for a sweet and satisfying fall side dish .'

microwave	b'From a spectroscopic point of view it is desirable to study a given molecule over as wide a spectral range as possible . Equipment is available to record transitions in the microwave infrared visible and ultraviolet regions . The infrared experiment uses a CO laser as the radiation source . The laser operates at one of several discrete frequencies in the range and it is necessary to tune a frequency into coincidence by application of a variable magnetic field . The experiment is called laser magnetic resonance LMR . In the visible and ultraviolet regions a tunable c.w. dye laser is used to record electronic spectra . The Doppler linewidth is so large at these wavelengths that it can mask some of the informative splittings . Experiments are therefore often performed within this linewidth using saturation effects .

Well that is exactly what Ecuador under your leadership has been doing . Few countries in the hemisphere have made the tough public stand against dictatorship left and right as has Ecuador . As you have pointed out on several occasions democracy and the protection of human rights is the surest way to peace as well as freedom . It is no mere coincidence that those few nations controlled by oppressive Communist regimes can be tied to so much of the turmoil and bloodshed that is plaguing this hemisphere . It should surprise no one that the rifles used to take over a court building and murder judges in a democratic nation can be traced to a country controlled by those who do believe in freedom human rights or democracy .

rifle	b'Now what was their other idea for reducing the deficit Oh yes cut military spending and as a few urge cut it to the bone . After their proposed tax increase the deficit according to their estimate would still be around 150 billion . Now remember we have already reduced our planned defense increase by 66 billion . We did that ourselves . Forget that defense spending as a share of the Federal budget is nearly 40 percent less today than it was under John F. Kennedy 20 years ago . Forget that the Russians have been us in defense by about 2 to 1 . We have a deficit left of about 150 billion which our opponents say can be eliminated by reduced defense spending . So let start by eliminating for an entire year spending on the Pershing missile the B 1 bomber the MX missile the cruise missile the Trident submarine and its missiles the M 1 tank and then cancel the orders for all the ammunition for all our weapons including even the bullets for our soldiers rifles .

rifle	b'The first audiometric sign of NIHL resulting from broadband noise is usually a loss of sensitivity in the higher frequencies from through Hertz Hz i.e. cycles per second resulting in a characteristic audiometric notch . With additional hearing loss from noise or aging the threshold at Hz may worsen and eliminate this characteristic audiometric pattern . Thus the presence or absence of NIHL can not be established on the basis of audiometric shape per se . The hearing loss is usually bilateral but some degree of asymmetry is not unusual especially with lateralized noise sources such as rifles . After moderate sound exposure TTS may occur and during a period of relative quiet thresholds will return to normal levels . If the exposure continues on a regular basis permanent threshold shifts PTS will result increasing in magnitude and extending to lower and higher frequencies . If the exposures continue NIHL increases more rapidly in the early years . After many years of exposure NIHL levels off in the high frequencies but continues to worsen in the low frequencies .'

In addition the Secretary of War gave bonuses to soldiers upon enlistment which while modest at first would still be of help to families while the men were off fighting . Many felt that they would be drafted anyway volunteering would at least leave the family better off . The new artillery doctrine called for cannon to form a line away from the action and fire upon the enemy but these Chicagoans had a taste for close combat and would prove it during their service from .

rifle	b'The fastest ordinary rifles had muzzle velocities of about 4000 feet per second and those that had been modified for use in the SSFF achieved velocities of perhaps 6000 feet per second . What Charters was attempting to do however was to develop a gun that would shoot simple bulletlike models at speeds of feet per second or more . The gun would derive energy from exploding powder and use rifle barrels for accelerating tubes but would otherwise bear little resemblance to a conventional rifle . In the new gun exploding powder would drive a metal piston down a barrel driving tube compressing just ahead of it a charge of helium gas . The hot compressed gas would finally burst through a sealing diaphragm into a second barrel launching tube in which the test model would be located . The compressed helium gas would then propel the model out of the second barrel at terrific speed . The reaction would be taken by ejecting a second piston out of the driving tube in the opposite direction . The reaction piston was to be caught in a special catcher . Since the gun in effect shot bullets in two opposite directions it was named Janus and the range in which it was first used was called the Janus range . Inasmuch as the driving gas in the gun was helium used because its small mass absorbed little accelerating energy the gun was known by the generic name of gun . It was on the development of such a device that Charters and his colleagues were working as 1953 ended .'
rifle	b'The necessity of minimizing the structural weight of the missile was a problem in itself . Any unnecessary weight in the structure would either greatly increase the weight and cost of the whole missile or more likely reduce the weight and power of the warhead . Thus the slightest unnecessary Weight in any part of the missile was intolerable . The explosive charge itself had a structural container the weight of which had to be minimized . Sitting atop the missile this warhead structure had been of pointed configuration m early designs . The use of a pointed nose for rifle shells and missiles was traditional . The concept was firmly implanted in the thinking'
rifle	b'Swift developed muzzle velocities of about 4000 feet per second and the ultimate velocity that seemed likely to be achievable with a rifle powered only by gunpowder appeared to be under feet per second .

rifle	b'Although the ballistic range the supersonic tunnel and the hypervelocity facility all had outstanding capabilities for simulating the aerothermodynamic conditions of flight they nevertheless possessed in common a couple of rather obvious faults . The conditions of model freedom and the short operating time rendered all measurements difficult and some impossible .

The models had to be small enough to be inserted into a rifle barrel and rugged enough to withstand accelerations of about 1 million times that of gravity .'
rifle	b'Certain other agencies to which Government funds were available had demonstrated that a rather high effectiveness could be achieved by a method employing approaches tons of money and rather low efficiency . This method could perhaps be likened to shooting squirrels with a shotgun whereas NACA with the pride of a professional hunter had chosen to stalk the game and shoot it between the eyes with a .22 rifle . Certainly the shotgun method was effective and if time was of the essence or the goal sufficiently important its use might well be justified . And perhaps the space age with its keen competitive challenges was such an occasion . Certainly the Congress now appeared in the mood to Spend real money for space research . But the shotgun method was so foreign'
rifle	b'The hypersonic ballistics range was made possible by the lightgas gun developed by a group of researchers working under Alex Charters who had come to Ames from the Aberdeen Proving Ground ballistics ranges .

Subsequent guns produced speeds up to . The gun was first tested in Ames Janus range a cylinder only 21 ft long built in the first stages of ballistics research . The NACA then approved a much larger range for the gun to be located near the Janus range in a new building on territory originally reserved for a seaplane towing basin . Such a research tool was no longer much in demand and in any event Langley already had one . The new range was in use by 1957 .'
rifle	b'To suit the requirements of so ambitious a voyage the spacecraft would have to be drastically modified . At Jupiter and beyond the Sun would be too distant to create enough solar cell power the spacecraft would have to carry a radioactive thermoelectric generator which uses plutonium isotopes to heat an array of thermocouples . The Franklin antenna with its pancake pattern could not produce a signal strength that could cope with such a distance . It would be replaced with a parabolic antenna mounted on the spin axis and aimed back at Earth with precision . In place of the earlier Pioneers simple little thruster systems for initial orientation and another for nudges to precess the spin axis there would now be no less than four pairs of thrusters arranged so that they could increase or decrease the spin rate torque the spin axis around in different directions or even accelerate or decelerate the whole spacecraft .

The large depression to the southwest is a rifle or channel through which lava once flowed the very eastern side and western side indicate that this feature is a trough with steep slopes . The presence of partly craters like this one is important in understanding the rate of resurfacing on Venus by volcanism . The lack of flooded craters suggests that the surface may have been covered by lava flows about 0.5 Ga ago burying all existing craters Schaber et al. 1992 . According to this model the craters now visible in the Magellan images represent impacts that occurred after this resurfacing event and there has been very little volcanic and other resurfacing since .'

Behold I should answer the natural effect of ignorance The mind will ever be unstable that has only prejudices to rest on and the current will run with destructive fury when there are no barriers to break its force . Women are told from their infancy and taught by the example of their mothers that a little knowledge of human weakness justly termed cunning softness of temper outward obedience and a scrupulous attention to a puerile kind of propriety will obtain for them the protection of man and should they be beautiful everything else is needless for at least twenty years of their lives .'

We seem to forget that it is upon the qualities of the female sex that our own domestic comforts and the education of our children must depend . And what are the comforts or the education which a race of being corrupted from their infancy and unacquainted with all the duties of life are fitted to bestow To touch a musical instrument with useless skill to exhibit their cultural or affected graces to the eyes of indolent and debauched young men to dissipate their husband patrimony in riotous and unnecessary expenses these are the only arts cultivated by women in most of the polished nations I had seen .

They accordingly ran together in the three towns near the Genesee river and after a short consultation agreed that Little Beard on the account of some old grudge which he yet cherished towards them had placed himself between them and the sun in order that their corn might not grow and so reduce them to a state of starvation . Having thus found the cause the next thing was to remove it which could only be done the use of powder and ball .

Mr. B. then rode up with the same order and we three started for a spring a mile distant having gathered up the empty canteens which lay strewn on the field .

Then some night in the Future Farmers of America shop at school to which I was privileged to have a key I would use the oxyacetylene torch to melt down my gold dust into a solid gleaming ingot . Secrecy of course was essential because I had heard that there was something vaguely illegal about melting gold .'

It was then that I learned two things 1 Forty pounds per square inch of pressure from any hose whatsoever is enough to scatter an eighth of an ounce of any kind of dust all over a workbench . 2 It is an old wives tale that gold just because it is soft is easy to melt . Even the few particles that I managed to salvage did seem to melt as easily as the scrap steel that we practiced on in shop .

The resulting tones and textures along with a reliance on richly romantic melodicism make for music that more pointedly pop than she sounded in the past but not so much as to be ordinary . There still plenty of personality in Case smoky and sultry voice as well as in her often eccentric lyrical perspective .

There may in fact only be three fingers on that hand and their names are Hendrix Hazel and Pete Cosey see Miles Davis Agharta if you have already . Most great rock guitar solos last only a few bars longer than the average male orgasm . As Hendrix had tapped into the big O infinite feminine side on Machine Gun so Hazel did likewise on Maggot and left us with a symphony worth of memorable ideas and transcendental catharsis . Like jazz when it really happening you want to drown in and dissect the notes at the same time . You also come to know every note because every one blows a hole in your solar plexus . The rest of the album has its charms Eddie sings on the ode Super Stupid think of it as an outtake from the Black album he t make likely because of one toot too many and Wars of Armageddon is electric Miles without Miles and before Miles even got so wildly electric .

taxi	b'The stated fundamental purpose of the Agreement is to simplify and modernize sales and use tax administration so that the burden of compliance is greatly reduced and treats all sellers regardless of their type of commerce equally . 25 The Agreement identifies ten 10 specific areas of focus including A. administration of sales and use tax B. uniformity in state and local tax bases C. uniformity of major tax base definitions D. a central electronic registration system for all member states E. simplification of state and local tax rates F. uniform sourcing rules for taxable transactions G H I. simplified exemptions tax returns and tax remittances and J. protection of consumer privacy . 26 Each state that becomes a member is required to provide state level administration of all their sales and use taxes so that sellers only have to register with and remit tax returns and funds at the state level eliminating the need to interact with the various local taxing jurisdictions within a state . Online registration systems must be established by each member state and no registration fees are allowed . 27 The states are then required to distribute the taxes amongst the appropriate taxing jurisdictions . 28 To provide for an orderly transition the Agreement requires states with local taxing jurisdictions have a common tax base throughout all of the local jurisdictions through December 31 2005 . After that date the local tax bases and the state base must be identical excepting the taxes levied on motor vehicles of all types . 29 After the December 31 2005 date states may not impose different tax rates on personal property except they may impose a single additional rate on food and food ingredients . 30 Further member states may not enact a product based exemption if the Agreement does not have a definition for the product and if there is a definition then any exemption must include all items within the definition . 31 State tax holidays must also incorporate only items defined in the Agreement and be uniformly applied throughout a state . 32 To make tax filing simpler for sellers and to reduce the number of errors all tax rate changes require advance notice defined as with as much advance notice practicable to requiring a minimum of sixty 60 days for local rate changes and that all take effect on the first calendar day of a new quarter . 33 Member states however bear the significant administrative burden as they must provide and maintain a database that describes boundaries for each taxing jurisdiction based on the five and nine digit zip codes .'
taxi	b'Defining terms consistently is one of the key objectives of the agreement supported by the National Governors Association in their Policy Position . 35 The Agreement establishes a library of definitions that each member state agrees to utilize which are set out in Appendix C of the Agreement . One of the more important definitions is defining the taxing source . Retail sales excluding leases or rentals are to be sourced when the products are received by the purchaser at a business location of a seller a location indicated in delivery instructions by the purchaser or an address of the purchaser included in the seller business records or ascertained during the consummation of the sale . If no receipt address is available then the seller is allowed to use the shipped from address for its taxing source . 36 Other special treatments and definitions are established for the sale of telecommunication services leased and rental transactions and goods and services subject to multiple points of use .'
taxi	b'Perhaps too the courts might even move toward the opinions expressed in the dissent of Miller Brothers and agree that states need to raise revenue to support their citizens and that vendors should be treated equally in state and out of state . Certainly states will continue to raise this issue as their revenue sources are impacted by the over all economy and . Courts may come to acknowledge that when an out of state vendor makes a sale even over the somewhat anonymous Internet they know the destination of the merchandise and the burden to add a tax is minimal . If states move to simplify their taxing structures then this argument becomes even stronger . Further states could argue and the courts agree that if Internet vendors are allowed to avoid collecting and paying sales taxes it will eventually discourage sticks and bricks retailers further harming their revenue base .'
taxi	b'Users must log onto their computers and choose to surf whether they use words tied to metatags or not . Further when a vendor creates and maintains their web site they do not control nor dictate who has access to it . They do not know which forums their marketing is directed to and therefore their actions can not be construed as purposeful . Courts could determine that the intellectual property owned by an or vendor does not find its situs in a forum state but rather it resides in the home state of such vendor or within the world wide web it merely travels through interstate commerce and never actually comes to rest . As differentiated in National Geographic the Internet has its connection with a taxing state exclusively by means of the instruments of interstate commerce .'
taxi	b'Where does the answer lie Is the voluntary SSTA the solution or would it run afoul of the legal tests for substantial nexus regardless of its good intentions The answer appears to lie with Congress . Just as in GEICO if Congress enacts the proposed streamlined sales tax provisions of either HR 1410 or Senate Bill 512 then the courts would focus on whether their delegation of taxing authority was valid rather than the uncertain tests of substantial nexus and due process .'
taxi	b'It is difficult to predict whether Internet purchases will remain tax free . Internet taxing provides both advantages and disadvantages to vendors consumers and government entities . However the question remains as to balancing the pros and cons of Internet taxation between the various entities . The advisory panel created by Congress to study the Internet sales tax issue is hopelessly divided . The challenge lies for governments and policy makers around the world to protect their sales and tax revenue models without adversely affecting the continued and diverse growth of electronic commerce . Some members want the Internet to be a zone others want Congress to require states to collect sales taxes on out of state purchases while states are simply trying to make ends meet . Because the Internet is the wave of the future and is continuing to grow exponentially the deadlock between the opposing views is not necessarily a bad thing . Electronic commerce is too important an engine for economic growth to ignore the risks of unintended consequences from premature application of Internet taxation . It may well be that the best thing for Congress to do is NOTHING .'
taxi	b'Regarding intrastate retail sales taxes jurisdiction is satisfied when a purchaser buys property within the taxing state but use taxes on interstate commerce are not so easily imposed or collected . As electronic commerce is almost always a question of interstate commerce the Commerce Clause has been a large limitation on the States power to tax certain purchases .'
taxi	b'The substantial nexus prong which has been interpreted by the Court as requiring a physical presence in the taxing state lxxxii has proven to be the most contentious of the prongs .'
taxi	b'If reform efforts such as economic presence as opposed to the current physical presence standard are considered state and local tax authorities could impose tax collection obligations on remote sellers meeting a certain threshold of activity but without simultaneous efforts to simplify this collection and administration the burden on interstate commerce may be too large . For now however states will rely on the Quill physical presence test in seeking jurisdiction over Internet vendors and sales in their state like they do for mail order companies and likely continue their efforts at simplifying and streamlining their taxes so that if the standards or laws change they may reasonably comply . Consumers though are much more difficult to predict . Some say that taxation of Internet sales is only the rightful collection of what is rightfully owed . Some say that the Internet is a new medium unaffected and undefined by current law and that taxing it in its infancy would stunt its potentially limitless growth . This growth however and the inability to harness it as revenue is the biggest concern of the States and as the Internet continues to grow so too will the issue .'
taxi	b'Whether the end result is a permanent tax moratorium on Internet access and sales or a compromise situation like the Streamlined Sales Tax Project where states may tax Internet sales to some degree Congress should seek to establish rules that are fair to traditional and online retailers state local and municipal taxing jurisdictions and easy to comply with and understand .'
taxi	b'Intangible as well as tangible properties may give rise to sufficient presence to satisfy the nexus requirements for the taxing state . A number of states have adopted the approach in Geoffrey where the state Supreme Court held that the licensing of a trademark used in the state was sufficient to subject the licensing company to state income tax . The analysis used by the court was one of purposeful availment resulting in more than a de minimis presence in the state . 69 The application of this approach could have enormous ramifications for electronic commerce where intangibles are readily distributable online possibly subjecting companies to tax liabilities in numerous jurisdictions .'
taxi	b'Transaction taxes are taxes like a sales tax . These types of taxes are unmanageable to collect from the buyer of the goods . It is next to impossible for a state to seek each buyer to remit the tax owed from each sale . Rather the resident vendors collect the tax and remit the collected amount to State tax authority . Most of state vendors refuse to collect and remit taxes . This is true for mail order as well as electronic commerce . The seminal United States Supreme Court case on establishing the minimum contacts and substantial nexus as it relates to electronic commerce is Quill Corp. v. North Dakota . 9 Here the Court defined physical presence to include such things as office equipment employees independent contractors agents or affiliates . North Dakota filed an action in state court to require petitioner Quill Corporation to collect and pay a use tax on goods purchased for use in the State . The Court found in Quill favor finding the case indistinguishable from National Bellas Hess in holding that a similar Illinois statute violated the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause and created an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce . 10 The Bellas Hess court concluded that a seller whose only connection with customers in the State is by common carrier or the mail lacked the requisite minimum contacts with the State . 11 The North Dakota State Supreme Court reversed the decision of the trial court . The state supreme court applied the rationale that pursuant to Complete Auto Transit 12 and its progeny the Commerce Clause no longer mandated t he sort of physical presence nexus suggested in Bellas Hess . Moreover with respect to the Due Process Clause cases following Bellas Hess had not construed minimum contacts to require physical presence within a State as a prerequisite to the legitimate exercise o f state power . The United States Supreme Court reversed the North Dakota Supreme court and held that a the Due Process Clause does not bar enforcement of the State use tax against Quill and that b the State enforcement of the use tax against Quill places an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce . The Supreme Court due process jurisprudence has grown wherein they have abandoned formalistic tests focused on a defendant presence within a state to a more flexible inquiry into whether a defendant contacts made it reasonable to require it to defend the suit in that State . To the extent that this Court decisions have indicated that the clause requires a physical presence in a State they are overruled . In this case Quill has purposefully directed its activities at North Dakota residents the magnitude of those contacts are more than sufficient for due process purposes and the tax is related to the benefits Quill receives from access to the State . 13 Moreover the Court went on to hold that the State enforcement of the use tax against Quill places an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce . The Court found that the Bellas Hess holding was not rendered obsolete by the Court subsequent decision in Complete Auto . which set forth the four part test that continues to govern the validity of state taxes under the Commerce Clause . Although Complete Auto renounced an analytical approach that looked to a statute formal language rather than its practical effect in determining a state tax statute validity the Bellas Hess decision did not rely on such formalism . Nor is Bellas Hess inconsistent with Complete Auto . It concerns the first part of the Complete Auto test and stands for the proposition that a vendor whose only contacts with the taxing State are by mail or common carrier lacks the substantial nexus required by the Commerce Clause . 14 Contrary to the State argument a mail order house may have the minimum contacts with a taxing State as required by the Due Process Clause and yet lack the substantial nexus with the State required by the Commerce Clause .'
taxi	b'Many states attempt to tax income that companies make from sales and other sources derived within the state . The authority to impose this tax is based on whether there is a nexus between the company and the state . Nexus can be defined as a seller minimum level of physical presence within a state that permits the taxing authority to require the seller to register collect and remit tax and comply with the state taxing statutes and regulations . Traditionally nexus is created when a seller has a physical presence in a location or has an agent of the company conducting business in a location . With respect to services while almost any activity that results in a sale of services over the internet can create a nexus services solely delivered electronically over the internet generally do not create nexus . It is important to keep in mind that this is generally speaking and states have been able to impose income tax based on nexus where the service provided was only an electronic one . The ability of a state to impose a tax on a company for the sale of tangible goods is limited by federal law which provides that a state has no power to impose income tax on income derived from the interstate sale of goods if the company only business activities in the state are soliciting but not accepting or filling orders in the state .'
taxi	b'The National League of Cities maintains that it is the federal government not the states and localities who are enacting new taxes referring to a tax increase that affects airline ticket prices when purchased over the internet . 19 Thus while it would seem that the states are clamoring for another source of income by taxing internet activities the states seem to be aware that they need to encourage access to the net by not taxing it for they are counting on the possible revenues .'
taxi	b'The Act prohibits a state or local government from imposing assessing or attempting to collect any tax or fee on the Internet or interactive computer services or on their use . It preserves state and local taxing authority with respect to income license and sales taxes .'
taxi	b'Jefferson Lines 514 U.S. at 185 . The external consistency test looks to the economic justification for the State claim upon the value taxed that is fairly attributable to economic activity within the taxing State .'
taxi	b'The court in Western Live Stock characterized a local state taxing event as an agreement payment and delivery of some of the service in the taxing State no other state can claim to be the site of the same combination .'
taxi	b'Why is their well running dry Because of the competitive advantage that some retailers e.g. vendors and vendors enjoy . This competitive advantage is their ability to sell products without taxing the purchaser . The reason that these vendors can do this is because they lack nexus with many states where their ultimate purchaser resides . Nexus simply means physical presence in the forum state . The states are not happy about this and are increasingly demanding that Congress do something to relax the nexus requirement that currently prevents states from taxing all goods purchased by their citizenry .'
taxi	b'Thus this segment of the Note begins by discussing the current status of laws governing states rights to tax vendors . The segment then discusses three possible solutions to the current problems with taxing and concludes by embracing the national uniform sales tax method as the method most equitable to retailers and local retailers as well .'
taxi	b'While this problem has existed for a long time it has never been enough of problem for states to go on the offensive to change the status quo . However with the advent of and an increasingly large chunk of state revenues being siphoned away by the vendors . States are beginning to lobby Congress to make changes in the nexus definition that has traditionally kept states from extending there taxing authority outside of their borders .'
taxi	b'In Quill the U.S. Supreme Court held that while states may meet the Due Process requirement of minimum contacts under Commerce Clause requirements states may still be precluded from requiring retailers such as catalog companies and Internet merchants to collect taxes unless they have a physical presence in the state creating a substantial nexus with the taxing state .'
taxi	b'The U.S. Supreme Court held that that business did not need to have physical presence in state in order to permit a state to require the business to collect use tax from its customers but physical presence in the state was required for the business to have a substantial nexus with the taxing state under the Commerce Clause .'
taxi	b'Those opposed to lifting the moratorium say forcing online merchants to comply with the taxing systems of thousands of jurisdictions will stifle development of the industry . 93 Additionally catalog companies do not have to pay taxes where they do have a physical presence so neither should online retailers the argument goes . Add to that the fact that online sales account for a small percentage of overall retail sales and moratorium supporters claim taxing an industry segment already weakened by a poor economy would be penny wise and pound foolish .'
taxi	b'The gargantuan growth of the Internet and the revolution of the telecommunications industry in the Internet age with accompanying technological developments have resulted in a significant challenge to state and local taxing schemes .'
taxi	b'For sales or use tax to be imposed the transaction involved must be taxable . The Georgia Department of Revenue which carries out the sales and use taxation powers provided to them by the Georgia General Assembly mandates that taxable sales must occur within a local jurisdiction . When the title of ownership of tangible personal property is transferred in a Georgia jurisdiction a taxable transaction has occurred . A taxable transaction is not deemed to have occurred if the tangible personal property is ordered and mailed and delivered to a purchaser that is outside of Georgia because the presumption is that the jurisdiction where the property is received is the taxing jurisdiction . 11 . In regards to use tax the lessee or owner of tangible personal property even if that property is derived outside of Georgia is subject to use tax if the first instance of use consumption or storage of the property occurs within Georgia . 12 .'
taxi	b'These clauses provide that the requirement for state taxing jurisdiction is that there must be a concrete relationship or at least some minimal connection between the state and the taxpayer 14 . The term for the aforementioned relationship is nexus which refers to the justification of state taxing authority because a taxpayer or their activities derive the benefits or opportunities of transacting business within that state . If the state provides no benefit to the taxpayer then their taxing authority is not justified . 15 .'
taxi	b'For there to be nexus two tests must be met . Does the taxpayer have minimum contact with the taxing jurisdiction so that they may be subject to tax 16 . And does a minimum contact exist between the taxing state and the activity that they seek to tax . The Supreme Court has held that not only must there be minimal contact between the taxpayer and the taxing state but a connection between the activity itself and the taxing state in order to establish jurisdiction . 17 .'
taxi	b'Although these two questions are similar the difference between the two inquiries is extremely important when examined in relation to the constitutional limits of state taxing authority of . 18 .'
taxi	b'The main issue the Court had to tackle was whether a company whose only contact with the state was by mail or common carrier had nexus with the state which would render them taxable for use tax purposes . The Supreme Court held that substantial presence is required for taxability under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution . If substantial presence requirements are met then the taxpayer is required to register with the taxing state collect use tax and distribute that tax to the taxing jurisdiction . The provisions of the Due Process Clause require minimal presence within the taxing jurisdiction for taxation to be constitutional and would allow a jurisdiction to require taxpayers provide information about their activities within the jurisdiction . In Quill case the Court held that the Due Process clause did not bar taxability because they had minimal presence in North Dakota . 22 . However the Court rendered the tax at issue unconstitutional as a burden on interstate commerce and as such in violation of the Commerce Clause . The requirements of substantial nexus were not met under the facts in Quill . 23 .'
taxi	b'The questions that arise in relation to taxation of are constantly multiplying and any possible solution in light of the current taxation scheme may be so complicated that the application is not viable in today economy . All of this coupled with the subjectivity of state application that may extend a state taxing authority to the limits of if not beyond constitutional restarints have many business and policy makers increasingly perplexed and concerned about the problems arising in the current and future digital age . The current law seems to either give jurisdictions the power to tax that would lead to oppression of or in other regards may leave them unable to tax items that would normally have been taxable .'
taxi	b'One of the main problems of taxation is the difficulty determining where the customer is located and whether the business or vendor has nexus with the taxing state or authority . Suppose there is a business that distributed software to a customer via the Internet who pays for the transaction by a credit card or some form of . The business sells their product throughout the United States and worldwide . They have a physical presence offices employee locations in New Mexico and California and they purchase their Internet access and server space from a business in Oregon .'
taxi	b'The above issues are just simple questions that arise from everyday operations yet these simple scenarios and transactions bring forth almost countless issues that threaten to disable current state and local taxing schemes or conversely to potentially oppress commerce if the current tax regimes are extended to allow for multistate taxation .'
taxi	b'Obviously the states may potentially lose much needed revenue from sales tax proceeds that they need to manage their affairs . These proceeds had been derived from traditional operations . With the advent of the Internet the nature of the beast has changed and the apparent solution is to extend state taxing authority to encompass transactions .'
taxi	b'The three year moratorium allows for a tax break from state and local taxation of Internet access from October 1 1998 to October 21 2001 moratorium has been extended as of August 2001 . A grandfather clause was incorporated to allow some states to continue taxing Internet access so long as the tax was generally imposed and actually enforced 51 on providers of the Internet before the date the moratorium was enacted .'
taxi	b'The reception of the ITFA has been mixed . Though the online business world supports the legislation state and local authorities are concerned about current and future impacts of their taxing power . One thing is for sure the moratorium is just a quick temporary solution to a problem .'
taxi	b'Another alternative is to create a third party tax collector to collect sales and use tax and remit them to states and even localities . For this to work sophisticated technology would need to be employed as a tool as well as some standardization of state taxing schemes . Though this may seem like a good option setting up such a system will be extremely difficult .'
taxi	b'Another possible solution is to reverse the current methodology for sales and use taxes . Instead of making the location of the customer the location of the taxing jurisdiction the taxing jurisdiction could be the location of the vendor . Therefore the vendor would apply sales tax every time they made a taxable sale and the rules of the tax jurisdiction where the vendor is located would apply . Problems with this model would be that identifying the location for tax purposes would still be difficult particularly when a vendor has multiple locations . This will particularly be the case for software sales or sales that involved multiple individuals in many locations . Benefits to this approach would be that customers would be neutral as to where they purchased an item and states would compete for vendors to create or relocate operations to their state through tax incentives or a lowered tax rate . 68 .'
taxi	b'Though many current sales and use tax systems are parallel in their approach in identifying taxable events and types of taxable transactions that are subject to sales and use tax there are thousands of state and local tax regimes throughout the United States . The very core of the various taxing systems have been shaken by the revolutionary new economy and the way that business is being done in the digital age . The Supreme Court has put forth a standard for taxation that is commensurate with the Constitutional safeguards of Due Process and the Commerce Clause but even these standards can not give state and local taxing authorities the guidance to deal with taxation issues .'
taxi	b'The federal government has sought to promote the growth of the Internet without significantly upsetting current state and local taxing systems by adopting and extending the tax moratorium provided by the Internet Tax Freedom Act . Though this Act has been criticized it is a method that allows a reprieve from pressing tax issues while the federal government examines the problem and attempts to discover solutions . The main consideration is to avoid hindering Internet and growth . The crux of the ITFA is to prevent states and localities from imposing multiple or discriminatory taxes . Despite these restrictions states and localities may still impose use tax and change the way that they impose sales and use tax as long as the changes are in accord with the mandates of Federal legislation .'

taxi	b'Antioxidants May Repair DNA Mutations What you eat can influence your cancer risk . With funding from AICR Robert Schiestl Ph.D. and his collaborator Ramune Reliene Ph.D. are looking at how resveratrol an antioxidant in grapes may reverse genetic damage that leads to a rare disease with an extremely high risk of cancer . Although scientists have been studying the relationship between substances in foods and genes for decades the term nutrigenomics was coined only a few years ago . According to Dr. Schiestl Professor of Pathology Environmental Health and Radiation Oncology at UCLA School of Medicine and Public Health Nutrigenomics research is particularly interested in discovering if people with genetic predispositions for diseases can be helped with nutritional interventions like a special diet . Recently Dr. Schiestl was awarded a grant from AICR to see whether antioxidants in grapes can slow the progression of a rare fatal disease called ataxia telangiectasia or AT . Patients with AT which is caused by a mutation in the ATM gene suffer from increasing neurological deterioration . They are at extremely high risk for leukemia lymphoma and other types of cancer . Most patients die before age 30 . There is no cure or treatment for the disease . Grape PotencyBased on his past laboratory work Dr. Schiestl knows that mice with this gene mutation known as mice suffer a higher frequency of chromosomal damage and develop more tumors than mice without this mutation . He thinks that substances such as resveratrol a potent antioxidant and phytochemical found in grapes might be able to reverse or slow the oxidative damage and genetic mutations . Resveratrol which is found at highest concentrations in the skin and seeds of grapes as well as in wine has been shown to have all kinds of antioxidant activities Dr. Schiestl explains including the prevention of genetic mutations . In the study Dr. Schiestl will feed two groups of mice either grape powder a food from dehydrated grapes that includes the skin and seeds as 10 percent of their diet or an equal percentage of pure resveratrol . Some of these mice will receive the diet in utero through their mothers diet while others will eat it as soon as they are weaned . A third group of mice will eat a regular diet . By comparing the effects of resveratrol alone with the effects of grape powder made from whole grapes Dr. Schiestl will determine if there are other components besides resveratrol in grapes that have antioxidant powers and if the whole grape is needed for a synergistic effect . We look at the frequency of DNA damage oxidative DNA damage and tumors in the mice says Dr. mice form black spots on their fur and black pigments in their eyes that are markers for genetic mutations . Dr. Schiestl and his team will count and measure the eye and fur spots on the mice and compare the numbers among the groups of mice to measure the frequency of DNA deletions . The amount of oxidative damage will be determined by measuring a chemical called in the mice DNA . Other Antioxidant TreatmentsDr . Schiestl project follows a series of previous experiments in which mice were fed an antioxidant called cysteine NAC in utero . NAC is a product used in cold remedies . In those studies NAC counteracted genetic instability so well that mice experienced no more DNA damage than normal mice . Based in part on these dramatic results a clinical trial for patients with AT is planned to test a treatment of several types of vitamins and phytochemicals as well as NAC . Dr. Schiestl research has the potential to help more than those with AT who number about one in to people . Another 5 percent of the population has a particular type of heterozygous ATM mutation . These people will not have AT but they are predisposed to certain types of cancer such as breast cancer and lymphoma . Furthermore several diseases result from genetic instabilities like AT . These include syndrome Bloom syndrome Werner syndrome and Fanconi anemia . All are associated with an increased risk for cancer . Scientists hope that antioxidants may play a role in preventing several diseases that come with genomic instability . ReferenceReliene R et al .

taxi	b'Antioxidants May Repair DNA MutationsWhat you eat can influence your cancer risk . With funding from AICR Robert Schiestl Ph.D. and his collaborator Ramune Reliene Ph.D. are looking at how resveratrol an antioxidant in grapes may reverse genetic damage that leads to a rare disease with an extremely high risk of cancer . Although scientists have been studying the relationship between substances in foods and genes for decades the term nutrigenomics was coined only a few years ago . According to Dr. Schiestl Professor of Pathology Environmental Health and Radiation Oncology at UCLA School of Medicine and Public Health Nutrigenomics research is particularly interested in discovering if people with genetic predispositions for diseases can be helped with nutritional interventions like a special diet . Recently Dr. Schiestl was awarded a grant from AICR to see whether antioxidants in grapes can slow the progression of a rare fatal disease called ataxia telangiectasia or AT . Patients with AT which is caused by a mutation in the ATM gene suffer from increasing neurological deterioration . They are at extremely high risk for leukemia lymphoma and other types of cancer . Most patients die before age 30 . There is no cure or treatment for the disease . Grape PotencyBased on his past laboratory work Dr. Schiestl knows that mice with this gene mutation known as mice suffer a higher frequency of chromosomal damage and develop more tumors than mice without this mutation . He thinks that substances such as resveratrol a potent antioxidant and phytochemical found in grapes might be able to reverse or slow the oxidative damage and genetic mutations . Resveratrol which is found at highest concentrations in the skin and seeds of grapes as well as in wine has been shown to have all kinds of antioxidant activities Dr. Schiestl explains including the prevention of genetic mutations .

taxi	b'This plan is aimed at reducing the growth in government spending and taxing reforming and eliminating regulations which are unnecessary and unproductive or counterproductive and encouraging a consistent monetary policy aimed at maintaining the value of the currency . If enacted in full this program can help America create 13 million new jobs nearly 3 million more than we would have without these measures . It will also help us to gain control of inflation .'
taxi	b'It important to note that we only reducing the rate of increase in taxing and spending . We not attempting to cut either spending or taxing levels below that which we presently have . This plan will get our economy moving again create productivity growth and thus create the jobs that our people must have .'
taxi	b'The taxing power of government must be used to provide revenues for legitimate government purposes . It must not be used to regulate the the economy or bring about social change . We tried that and surely we must be able to see it does work .'
taxi	b'Only a constitutional amendment will do the job . We tried the carrot and it failed . With the stick of a balanced budget amendment we can stop government squandering overtaxing ways and save our economy .'
taxi	b'In a way I guess I can understand why so many of our political leaders fell into this trap . I sure they did it with the best of intentions . It easy to lose touch with reality when it is other people money that you spending . And there are so many things you want to do for those or this or that group so many programs many of them quite attractive and that can only be subsidized by more government taxing spending and borrowing . I can understand how it happened . Indeed like many others for a time I accepted government claim that it was sound economics . But there came a day when I and millions of other Americans began to realize the terrible consequences of all those years of playing politics as usual while the economic disaster lines crept higher and higher .'
taxi	b'months ago we faced five critical problems high taxes runaway government spending inflation high interest rates and unemployment . Getting to the roots of unemployment meant fighting inflation and high interest rates caused by runaway government spending and taxing because we know that when inflation shoots up it triggers a rise in unemployment . Now inflation is being driven back down and lower unemployment will follow .'
taxi	b'With your support we can show the world that we learned our lesson and that this time we going to get the job done and get it done right . This time we going to keep inflation interest rates and government spending taxing and borrowing down and get Americans back on the job .'
taxi	b'Our country has made great strides in this direction during the last 3 years . We correcting past mistakes . Hope is being reborn . Confidence is returning . America future looks bright again . We have turned the corner from overtaxing overspending record interest rates high inflation and low growth . The United States is beginning the first stage of a new industrial renaissance and we helping pull other nations forward to worldwide recovery .'
taxi	b'The President . Yes . I do believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget he has a plan for raising taxes . And as a matter of fact the biggest single tax increase in our nation history took place 1977 . And for the 5 years previous to our taking office taxes doubled in the United States and the budgets increased 318 billion . So there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget . Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people you taking the same amount of money out of the private sector unless and until you bring down government share of what it is taking .'
taxi	b'Now I do think that to try and say that we were taxing the rich and not the other way around it just does work out that way . The system is still where it was with regard to the progressivity as I said and that has not been changed . But if you take it in numbers of dollars instead of percentage yes you could say well that person got 10 times as much as this other person . Yes but he paid 10 times as much also . But if you take it in percentages then you find out that it is fair and equitable across the board .'
taxi	b'Those tax increases to pay for his promises add up to the equivalent of per household in this country . If Harry Truman had to apply a motto to this radical taxing scheme he would have to say that Your buck never stops . Laughter When the centerpiece of his economic program is backbreaking tax hikes you can see why my opponent spends so much time using outrageous scare tactics .'
taxi	b'You know in our debate I got a little angry some of those times when he was distorting my record . And on one occasion I was about to say to him very sternly Mr. Mondale you are taxing my patience . Laughter And then I caught myself . Why should I give him another idea'
taxi	b'But there more to it than that . Some years ago an historian I believe said that every time in the past when a government began taxing above a certain level of the people earnings trust in government began to erode . He said it would begin with efforts to avoid paying the full tax . This would become outright cheating and eventually a distrust and contempt of government itself until there would be a breakdown in law and order .'
taxi	b'America is now coming through a painful period of adjustment and recovery . We suffering the structural problems of an industrial society that being transformed in many ways one of them into more of a service and information society as well as paying the price for years and years of big spending big taxing and overregulation in Washington .'
taxi	b'At any rate here we are at midpoint in the first term so I thought a little personal perspective might be appropriate . Looking back I guess my greatest satisfaction is the conviction that a country that was skidding dangerously in the wrong direction losing the respect of friends and foes alike in the world and even worse losing faith in its own future has been set on the right course . We begun to undo the damage that the overtaxing overspending overregulating binge of the sixties and seventies inflicted on the American way of life and we made America respected in the world again .'
taxi	b'Well let take a look at that . In Chicago 1980 when I proposed an economic program which was the program we brought to Washington I said that we would try to bring taxing down to 20.6 percent of gross national product . And then we would try also to bring spending down to where those levels matched . Well when we submitted our tax program we did get it the way we wanted it . We did get the 10 percent retroactive to January 1st . We got 5 percent in October then 10 percent only 6 months ago and the next 10 percent in the next few months we will get . But we still got more tax cut than we had asked for . But while they were delaying those cuts that we thought would have had more stimulative effect had we gotten what we asked for even those who said they were opposed to tax cuts could resist hanging a lot of Christmas tree ornaments on the bill .'
taxi	b'Just 3 years ago we inherited the worst economic mess in decades . Big taxing and spending had led to soaring inflation and interest rates government redtape had smothered productivity . In January of inflation was in double digits the prime interest rate was at its highest peak since the Civil War and growth in industry and productivity was disappearing .'
taxi	b'In closing just let me express that I have every confidence that we can control government spending taxing and in doing so ensure a lasting era of growth and opportunities for all our people . Although the rhetoric gets thick at times especially during election years the leaders of both political parties are individuals of good will individuals who want what best for this country . Nobody should ever sell America or Americans short .'
taxi	b'After we come so far we must never turn back to the old destructive habits of taxing and spending . With a future beckoning so brightly we must move forward on the optimistic path of economic growth and expanding opportunity . Do let anyone underestimate America .'
taxi	b'Mr. Brokaw . Mr. President football is a metaphor for so many things in American life including politics . Now at the end of this game today one team is going to be in a deficit situation and all those players are going to face a very taxing year in 1986 . You about to deliver the State of the Union Address . Are you going to put the American people through the same experience in 1986 a taxing year'
taxi	b'The President . I do like the use of that word . It might be taxing for me and my energy . But I do like the idea that someone might hear this and think I thinking of taxing them because I not . Laughter I do want any tax increase .'
taxi	b'On another point you should also be aware that the amount spent on education in America has increased every year of our administration . Instead of taxing it away from local people and giving it back to them along with Federal guidelines and controls we left that revenue in local coffers and in your hands so you the people working with your local school boards can determine how your children will be educated . As for higher education the Federal Government will be spending less but with the changes we proposed fewer dollars are needed to help the same number of students .'
taxi	b'Despite the enormous progress we have already made in bringing down inflation there is still work to be done . Inflation is a hidden insidious way of taxing the American people . Price stability not merely lowered inflation is the key to maintaining the vigor of the American economy and the strong international role of the dollar . Stable predictable monetary policy can provide the type of price stability that benefits not only our own economy but also provides significant benefits to those developing countries that are so dependent upon us .'
taxi	b'Federal regulations that place needless burdens on people businesses and State and local governments . As we strive to control taxing and spending we must also cut back government regulations that are anticompetitive excessively stringent or just plain unnecessary .'
taxi	b'The confiscatory taxing of estates and inheritances has been halted as well . By raising the exemption to by lowering the rate to 50 and by removing the limits on the marital deduction 99.7 of all estates will eventually be exempt from estate taxation . American farmers small businessmen investors and workers can once again be confident that the sweat sacrifices and accumulations of a lifetime will belong to their heirs rather than their Government .'
taxi	b'An Federal Government with Federal Government big taxing and big spending does work never has worked and never will . Those who cling to the policies of yesterday who offer us only retreat would condemn us and our children to decades more of economic decay decades in which our days of greatness would be just a dim memory .'
taxi	b'And what do you know Inflation has dropped to single digits for the first time in 3 years but it not low enough . Interest rates are below their once dizzying heights and yet they not low enough . Our tax and budget cuts were the largest in history but they only reduced the rate of increase in taxing and spending . We must hold firm to our tax cuts and reduce the budget even more . We have much to do before we see the light but I think we at last and at least approaching the bend in the tunnel .'
taxi	b'The substantially expanded role of the Federal Government has been far deeper and broader than even the growing burden of spending and taxing would suggest . Over the past decade the government has spun a vast web of regulations that intrude into almost every aspect of every American working day . This regulatory web adversely affects the productivity of our Nation businesses farms educational institutions State and local governments and the operations of the Federal Government itself . That lessened productivity growth in turn increases the costs of the goods and services we buy from each other . And those regulations raise the cost of government at all levels and the taxes we pay to support it .'
taxi	b'Upon coming into office my Administration set out to design and carry out a economic program that would decisively reverse the trends of the past and make growth and prosperity the norm rather than the exception for the American economy . To that end my first and foremost objective has been to improve the performance of the economy by reducing the role of the Federal Government in all its many dimensions . This involves a commitment to reduce Federal spending and taxing as a share of gross national product . It means a commitment to reduce progressively the size of the Federal deficit . It involves a substantial reform of Federal regulation eliminating it where possible and simplifying it where appropriate . It means eschewing the economic policies of the past which with their focus only added to our economic ills .'
taxi	b'A reduced role for the Federal Government means an enhanced role for State and local governments . A wide range of Federal activities can be more appropriately and efficiently carried out by the States . I am proposing in my Budget Message a major shift in this direction . This shift will eliminate the freight charge imposed by the Federal Government on the taxpayers money when it is sent to Washington and then doled out again . It will permit a substantial reduction in Federal employment involved in administering these programs . Transfers of programs will permit public sector activities to be more closely tailored to the needs and desires of the electorate bringing taxing and spending decisions closer to the people . Furthermore as a result of last year Economic Recovery Tax Act Federal taxation as a share of national income will be substantially reduced providing States and localities with an expanded tax base so that they can finance those transferred programs they wish to continue . That tax base will be further increased later in this decade as Federal excise taxes are phased out .'
taxi	b'To carry out these policies for the 1980s my Administration has put into place a series of fundamental and changes in Federal Government spending taxing and regulatory policy and we have made clear our support for a monetary policy that will steadily bring down inflation .'
taxi	b'And they think that it is a way of taxing people on their savings and so forth . But what we have discovered is that one of the largest areas of avoidance of tax is in that field that this has been the biggest loophole whereby people just simply do not pay a tax they legitimately owe . It virtually impossible even in a computerized age for the Treasury Department bureau of internal revenue to be able to track this down . So we passed this .'
taxi	b'America is emerging from a painful period of adjustment . We paying the price for years and years of big spending big taxing and overregulation . We also suffering the structural problems of an industrial society transforming into more of a service and information society . Our traditional basic industries are not about to die away . America must never abandon them . They fundamental to our economic base . But each of us from corporate president to government official to millions of men and women in the marketplace must recognize what is happening so that we can harness the forces of change to help all of our people .'
taxi	b'But whether it cutting spending and taxing shrinking the size of the deficit ending overregulation inefficiency fraud and waste in government cracking down on career criminals revitalizing American education pressing for prayer and abortion legislation I think you can see that the agenda we put before America these past 2 years has been a conservative one . Oh and there are two other matters that I think you be interested in . First as part of our federalism effort next week we will be sending to the Congress our proposal for four megablock grants that will return vital prerogatives to the States where they belong . And second the Office of Management and Budget will press ahead with new regulations prohibiting the use of Federal tax dollars for purposes of political advocacy .'
taxi	b'This is one of the big things that has made us less competitive with our foreign allies . Japan many companies in Europe after World War II when there been so much destruction and all they were helped by us to build the most modern of factories . Well ours were bombed and the result was with our taxing policies since the war we made it very difficult for American business to modernize plant and equal these other plants and be able to produce at the lower price that they could produce . And we are providing incentives for that .'
taxi	b'All of us remember all too painfully the crisis our country faced just a few years ago . Big taxing and spending had led to soaring interest rates and inflation and our defenses had grown weak . All over the world America had become known not for strength and resolve but for vacillation and .'
