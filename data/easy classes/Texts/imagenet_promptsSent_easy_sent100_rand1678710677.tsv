They could do so because of a genetic freak a spontaneous mutation in a kind of banana native to Southeast Asia 
banana	The new mutation also had a characteristic that made transport possible all the bananas on a stalk ripen at once about three weeks after they grown to harvestable size . A ripening banana like some other fruits gives off ethylene gas which triggers ripening in nearby fruit . In older banana varieties a fruit or two ripens quickly after cutting

bucket	The buildup of air pollution resembles the filling of a leaky bucket . The size of the bucket is determined by vertical mixing while the leakiness is controlled by wind speed . You need a waterfall to fill an enormous bucket with many large leaks but a trickle of water could overflow a small bucket with a single pinhole

bucket	While the expansion of water as it freezes is the underlying cause of bursting pipes and bent buckets the actual deformation or breakage of the water container results from a secondary consequence of the expansion namely hydraulic pressure in that part of the water last to freeze 
bucket	A metal bucket set on a block of styrofoam ends up with a bulged bottom created by the hydraulic pressure in the last water to freeze in this case at the bottom of the bucket . Yet if the styrofoam is placed on the top of the bucket no bulging occurs because the last water to freeze is near the top surface where there is no metal to be bent 
bucket	Hence if one places a wooden or other insulating bucket filled with hot water out in the cold and places beside it a similar bucket equally filled with cold water the two will evaporate unequally . By the time both come down to the same temperature a temperature still above freezing the bucket originally containing hot water will contain less water than the one originally filled with cold . If the walls of the buckets are vertical both liquids contained therein still have the same surface area exposed to air so the rate of evaporation from this time on is essentially the same in both . Since cooling is presumed to continue to be only by evaporation the bucket with the least water must reach freezing temperature the soonest

bucket	If there is some problem with obtaining or sending the bucket brigades or the buckets in it filters need to return the error returned by the method that tried to manipulate the bucket brigade or the bucket 
bucket	A bucket represents a chunk of data . Each bucket in a brigade can be modified removed and replaced with another bucket . To manipulate a bucket one does need to know its internal representation 
bucket	The stream of data is represented by bucket brigades . by modifying some buckets and passed to the next filter in the stack 
bucket	The figure tries to show that after the presented bucket brigade has passed through several filters some buckets were removed some modified and some added . Of course the handler that gets the brigade can not tell the history of the brigade it can only see the existing buckets in the brigade 
bucket	The first using the connection socket to read and write the data and the second using bucket brigades to accomplish the same and allow for connection filters to do their work 
bucket	Now let look at the same module but this time implemented by manipulating bucket brigades and which runs its output through a connection output filter that turns all uppercase characters into their lowercase equivalents 
bucket	The handler receives the incoming data via bucket bridges one at a time in a loop . It then process each bridge by retrieving the buckets contained in it reading the data in then creating new buckets using the received data and attaching them to the outgoing brigade . When all the buckets from the incoming bucket brigade were transformed and attached to the outgoing bucket brigade a flush bucket is created and added as the last bucket so when the outgoing bucket brigade is passed out to the outgoing connection filters it wo be buffered but sent to the client right away 
bucket	We could simply pass the whole brigade unmodified without even looking at the buckets . To accomplish that modification simply add a code that transforms the data which has been read from the bucket before it inserted to the outgoing brigade 
bucket	These data chunks are stored in buckets which form bucket brigades . Input and output filters massage the data in bucket brigades . Response and protocol handlers also receive and send data using bucket brigades though in most cases this is hidden behind wrappers such as read and print . filters can directly manipulate the bucket brigades or use the simplified streaming interface where the filter object acts similar to a filehandle which can be read from and printed to 
bucket	Even though you do use bucket brigades directly when you use the streaming filter interface which works on bucket brigades behind the scenes it still important to understand bucket brigades . For example you need to know that an output filter will be invoked as many times as the number of bucket brigades sent from an upstream filter or a content handler . Or you need to know that the end of stream indicator EOS is sometimes sent in a separate bucket brigade so it should be a surprise that the filter was invoked even though no real data went through . As we delve into the filter details you will see that understanding bucket brigades will help to understand how filters work 
bucket	Filters get invoked as many times as the number of bucket brigades sent from an upstream filter or a content provider 
bucket	Filters should never make an assumption that the EOS bucket is arriving alone in a bucket brigade . Therefore the first output filter will be invoked two or three times three times if EOS is coming in its own brigade depending on the number of bucket brigades sent by the response handler 
bucket	A user may install an upstream filter and that filter may decide to insert extra bucket brigades or collect all the data in all bucket brigades passing through it and send it all down in one brigade 
bucket	it possible that one brigade will include the beginning of the token will come in the next bucket brigade on the next filter invocation . In certain cases it may involve more than two bucket brigades to get the whole token . Another good example is a filter that performs data compression compression is usually effective only when applied to relatively big chunks of data so if a single bucket brigade does contain enough data the filter may need to buffer the data in the filter context till it collects enough of it 
bucket	So if this test is performed at the beginning of the handler and the EOS bucket was sent in together with the data the EOS event may be missed and filter wo function properly 
bucket	Depending on whether this is an input or an output filter the blocking happens when the bucket brigade is requested from the upstream filter or when the bucket brigade is passed to the downstream filter 
bucket	First of all the input and output filters differ in the ways they acquire the bucket brigades which includes the data that they filter . Instead of reading the data in and printing it out the bucket brigades are now passed as is 
bucket	Here the first filter acquires the bucket brigades containing the response data from the content handler or another protocol handler if we are talking HTTP it then may apply some modification and pass the data to the next filter using the passbrigade call which in turn applies its modifications and sends the bucket brigade to the next filter etc . Even though the output filters do have to wait to acquire the bucket brigade since the upstream filter passes it to them as an argument they still block in a similar fashion to input filters since they have to wait for the passbrigade call to return 
bucket	modperl provides two interfaces to filtering a direct bucket brigades manipulation interface and a simpler interface 
bucket	If we are in the input mode in the same call we retrieve the bucket brigade from the previous filter on the input filters stack and immediately link it to the bb variable which makes the bucket brigade available to the next input filter when the filter handler returns . Next we call bbdump which dumps the type of the filter and the contents of the bucket brigade to STDERR without influencing the normal data flow 
bucket	If we are in the output mode the bb variable already points to the current bucket brigade 
bucket	We can see that for this request each header is put into a separate brigade with a single bucket 
bucket	So far all the buckets were of the HEAP type meaning that they were allocated from the heap memory . Notice that the HTTP request input filters will never see the bucket brigades with HTTP headers as it has been consumed by the last core connection filter 
bucket	The request filter sees a bucket brigade with a single bucket of type TRANSIENT which is allocated from the stack memory 
bucket	Create a new empty bucket brigade ctxbb pass it to the upstream filter via getbrigade and wait for this call to return . When it returns ctxbb is populated with buckets . Now the filter should move the bucket from ctxbb to bb on the way modifying the buckets if needed . Once the buckets are moved and the filter returns the downstream filter will receive the populated bucket brigade 
bucket	Pass bb to getbrigade to the upstream filter so it will be populated with buckets . Once getbrigade returns the filter can go through the buckets and modify them in place or it can do nothing and just return in which case the downstream filter will receive the bucket brigade unmodified 
bucket	Both techniques allow addition and removal of buckets . Though the second technique is more efficient since it does have the overhead of create the new brigade and moving the bucket from one brigade to another 
bucket	As promised in this filter handler we have used the first technique of bucket brigade modification . The handler creates a temporary bucket brigade ctxbb populates it with data using getbrigade and then moves buckets from it to the bucket brigade bb which is then retrieved by the downstream filter when our handler returns 
bucket	Now you probably ask yourself why did we have to go through the bucket brigades filters when this all can be done so much simpler . In certain cases a bucket brigade filter may be more efficient than the . For example if the filter applies transformation to selected buckets certain buckets may contain open filehandles or pipes rather than real data . And when you call read the buckets will be forced to read that data in . But if you did want to modify these buckets you could pass them as they are and let Apache do faster techniques for sending data from the file handles or pipes 
bucket	It only possible to get more than one bucket brigade from the same filter handler invocation if the filter is not using the streaming interface and by simply calling getbrigade as many times as needed or till EOS is received 
bucket	Moreover a single line may be split between across two or even more bucket brigades so we have to store the unprocessed string in the filter context so it can be used on the following invocations 
bucket	The bucket brigades output filter version is just a bit more complicated than the one . The handler receives the incoming bucket brigade bb as its second argument . Since when the handler is completed it must pass a brigade to the next filter in the stack we create a new bucket brigade into which we are going to put the modified buckets and which eventually we pass to the next filter 
bucket	The core of the handler is in removing buckets from the head of the bucket brigade bb while there are some reading the data from the buckets reversing and putting it into a newly created bucket which is inserted to the end of the new bucket brigade . If we see a bucket which designates the end of stream we insert that bucket to the tail of the new bucket brigade and break the loop 
bucket	It quite possible that reading one bucket brigade is not enough 
bucket	When the filter realizes that it does have enough data in the current bucket brigade it can store the read data in the filter context and wait for the next invocation of itself which may or may not satisfy its needs 
bucket	Instead of returning an empty bb the input filter can initiate the retrieval of extra bucket brigades until the underrun condition gets resolved 
bucket	It is clear from the debugging output that the filter was invoked only three times instead of six times there were six bucket brigades . Notice that the upstread input filter if any was aware that there were six bucket brigades since it saw only three . Our example filter did do much with those tokens so it has only repackaged data from 8kb per bucket brigade to 16389 bytes per bucket brigade 
bucket	Once the underrun condition is satisfied we have at least one complete token the tokens are put into a bucket brigade and returned to the upstream filter for processing keeping any remainders in the filter context for the next invocations or flushing all the remaining data if EOS has been seen 
bucket	In this module we use flattenbb to read the data from the buckets and signal when the EOS is received 
bucket	If a filter desires to store the incoming buckets for post processing . It must check whether the bucket type is transient . If not the buckets may contain corrupted data when used later . The right thing is accomplished transparently by aprbucketsetaside for which we need to provide a perl glue

taxi	26 Each state that becomes a member is required to provide state level administration of all their sales and use taxes so that sellers only have to register with and remit tax returns and funds at the state level eliminating the need to interact with the various local taxing jurisdictions within a state . 27 The states are then required to distribute the taxes amongst the appropriate taxing jurisdictions . 28 To provide for an orderly transition the Agreement requires states with local taxing jurisdictions have a common tax base throughout all of the local jurisdictions through December 31 2005 . 33 Member states however bear the significant administrative burden as they must provide and maintain a database that describes boundaries for each taxing jurisdiction based on the five and nine digit zip codes 
taxi	One of the more important definitions is defining the taxing source . If no receipt address is available then the seller is allowed to use the shipped from address for its taxing source 
taxi	If states move to simplify their taxing structures then this argument becomes even stronger 
taxi	As differentiated in National Geographic the Internet has its connection with a taxing state exclusively by means of the instruments of interstate commerce 
taxi	Just as in GEICO if Congress enacts the proposed streamlined sales tax provisions of either HR 1410 or Senate Bill 512 then the courts would focus on whether their delegation of taxing authority was valid rather than the uncertain tests of substantial nexus and due process 
taxi	Internet taxing provides both advantages and disadvantages to vendors consumers and government entities 
taxi	Regarding intrastate retail sales taxes jurisdiction is satisfied when a purchaser buys property within the taxing state but use taxes on interstate commerce are not so easily imposed or collected 
taxi	The substantial nexus prong which has been interpreted by the Court as requiring a physical presence in the taxing state lxxxii has proven to be the most contentious of the prongs 
taxi	Some say that the Internet is a new medium unaffected and undefined by current law and that taxing it in its infancy would stunt its potentially limitless growth 
taxi	Whether the end result is a permanent tax moratorium on Internet access and sales or a compromise situation like the Streamlined Sales Tax Project where states may tax Internet sales to some degree Congress should seek to establish rules that are fair to traditional and online retailers state local and municipal taxing jurisdictions and easy to comply with and understand 
taxi	Intangible as well as tangible properties may give rise to sufficient presence to satisfy the nexus requirements for the taxing state 
taxi	It concerns the first part of the Complete Auto test and stands for the proposition that a vendor whose only contacts with the taxing State are by mail or common carrier lacks the substantial nexus required by the Commerce Clause . 14 Contrary to the State argument a mail order house may have the minimum contacts with a taxing State as required by the Due Process Clause and yet lack the substantial nexus with the State required by the Commerce Clause 
taxi	Nexus can be defined as a seller minimum level of physical presence within a state that permits the taxing authority to require the seller to register collect and remit tax and comply with the state taxing statutes and regulations 
taxi	19 Thus while it would seem that the states are clamoring for another source of income by taxing internet activities the states seem to be aware that they need to encourage access to the net by not taxing it for they are counting on the possible revenues 
taxi	It preserves state and local taxing authority with respect to income license and sales taxes 
taxi	The external consistency test looks to the economic justification for the State claim upon the value taxed that is fairly attributable to economic activity within the taxing State 
taxi	The court in Western Live Stock characterized a local state taxing event as an agreement payment and delivery of some of the service in the taxing State no other state can claim to be the site of the same combination 
taxi	This competitive advantage is their ability to sell products without taxing the purchaser . The states are not happy about this and are increasingly demanding that Congress do something to relax the nexus requirement that currently prevents states from taxing all goods purchased by their citizenry 
taxi	The segment then discusses three possible solutions to the current problems with taxing and concludes by embracing the national uniform sales tax method as the method most equitable to retailers and local retailers as well 
taxi	States are beginning to lobby Congress to make changes in the nexus definition that has traditionally kept states from extending there taxing authority outside of their borders 
taxi	Supreme Court held that while states may meet the Due Process requirement of minimum contacts under Commerce Clause requirements states may still be precluded from requiring retailers such as catalog companies and Internet merchants to collect taxes unless they have a physical presence in the state creating a substantial nexus with the taxing state 
taxi	Supreme Court held that that business did not need to have physical presence in state in order to permit a state to require the business to collect use tax from its customers but physical presence in the state was required for the business to have a substantial nexus with the taxing state under the Commerce Clause 
taxi	Those opposed to lifting the moratorium say forcing online merchants to comply with the taxing systems of thousands of jurisdictions will stifle development of the industry . Add to that the fact that online sales account for a small percentage of overall retail sales and moratorium supporters claim taxing an industry segment already weakened by a poor economy would be penny wise and pound foolish
